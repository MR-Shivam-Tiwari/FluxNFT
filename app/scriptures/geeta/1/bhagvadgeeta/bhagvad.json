Then, having heard that great tumult, Arjuna and Sri Krsna the Lord of all lords, who was acting as the charioteer of Arjuna, sitting in their great chariot which was powerful enough to coner the three worlds; blew their divine conchs Srimad Pancajanya and Devadatta. Then, both Yudhisthira and Bhima blew their respective conchs separately. That tumult rent asunder the hearts of your sons, led by Duryodhana.

The sons of Dhrtarastra then thought, 'Our cause is almost lost now itself.' So said Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra who was longing for their victory. Sanjaya said to Dhrtarastra: Then, seeing the Kauravas, who were ready for battle, Arjuna, who had Hanuman, noted for his exploit of burning Lanka, as the emblem on his flag on his chariot, directed his charioteer Sri Krsna, the Supreme Lord-who is overcome by parental love for those who take shelter in Him who is the treasure-house of knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour, whose sportive delight brings about the origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos at His will, who is the Lord of the senses, who controls in all ways the senses inner and outer of all, superior and inferior - by saying, 'Station my chariot in an appropriate place in order that I may see exactly my enemies who are eager for battle.'"

He was grief-stricken within.

Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

आदि जो संसारके बीजभूत दोष है उनकी उत्पत्तिका कारण दिखलानेके लिये है। क्योंकि कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये इत्यादि श्लोकोंद्वारा अर्जुनने इसी तरह राज्य गुरु पुत्र मित्र सुहृद स्वजन सम्बन्धी और बान्धवोंके विषयमें यह मेरे हैं मैं इनका हूँ इस प्रकार अज्ञानजनित स्नेहविच्छेद आदि कारणोंसे होनेवाले अपने शोक और मोह दिखाये हैं। यद्यपि ( वह अर्जुन ) स्वयं ही पहले क्षात्रधर्मरूप युद्धमें प्रवृत्त हुआ था तो भी शोकमोहके द्वारा विवेकविज्ञानके दब जानेपर ( वह ) उस युद्धसे रुक गया और भिक्षाद्वारा जीवननिर्वाह करना आदि दूसरोंके धर्मका आचरण करनेके लिये प्रवृत्त हो गया। इसी तरह शोकमोह आदि दोषोंसे जिनका चित्त घिरा हुआ हो ऐसे सभी प्राणियोंसे स्वधर्मका त्याग और निषिद्ध धर्मका सेवन स्वाभाविक ही होता है।    यदि वे स्वधर्मपालनमें लगे हुए हों तो भी उनके मन वाणी और शरीरादिकी प्रवृत्ति फलाकांक्षापूर्वक और अहंकारसहित ही होती है। ऐसा होनेसे पुण्यपाप दोनों बढ़ते रहनेके कारण अच्छेबुरे जन्म और सुखदुःखोंकी प्राप्तिरूप संसार निवृत्त नहीं हो पाता अतः शोक और मोह यह दोनों संसारके बीजरूप हैं। इन दोनोंकी निवृत्ति सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञानके अतिरिक्त अन्य उपायसे नहीं हो सकती। अतः उसका ( आत्मज्ञानका ) उपदेश करने की इच्छावाले भगवान् वासुदेव सब लोगोंपर अनुग्रह करने के लिये अर्जुनको निमित्त बनाकर कहने लगे अशोच्यान् इत्यादि। इसपर कितने ही टीकाकार कहते हैं कि केवल सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक आत्मज्ञाननिष्ठामात्रसे ही कैवल्यकी ( मोक्षकी ) प्राप्ति नहीं हो सकती किंतु अग्निहोत्रादि श्रौतस्मार्तकर्मोंसहित ज्ञानसे मोक्षकी प्राप्ति होती है यही सारी गीताका निश्चित अभिप्राय है। इस अर्थमें वे प्रमाण भी बतलाते हैं जैसे अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धम्यं सङ्ग्रामं न करिष्यसि कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वम् इत्यादि। ( वे यह भी कहते हैं कि ) हिंसा आदिसे युक्त होनेके कारण वैदिक कर्म अधर्मका कारण है ऐसी शंका भी नहीं करनी चाहिये क्योंकि गुरु भ्राता और पुत्रादिकी हिंसा ही जिसका स्वरूप है ऐसा अत्यन्त क्रूर युद्धरूप क्षात्रकर्म भी स्वधर्म माना जानेके कारण अधर्मका हेतु नहीं है ऐसा कहनेवाले तथा उसके न करनेमें ततः स्वधर्म कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि इस प्रकार दोष बतलानेवाले भगवान्का यह कथन तो पहले ही सुनिश्चित हो जाता है कि जीवनपर्यन्त कर्म करें इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्योंद्वारा वर्णित पशु आदिकी हिंसारूप कर्मोंको करना अधर्म नहीं है। परंतु वह ( उन लोगोंका कहना ) ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि भिन्नभिन्न दो बुद्धियोंके आश्रित रहनेवाली ज्ञाननिष्ठा और कर्मनिष्ठाका अलगअलग वर्णन है। अशोच्यान् इस श्लोकसे लेकर स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य इस श्लोकके पहलेके प्रकरणसे भगवान्ने जिस परमार्थआत्मतत्त्वका निरूपण किया है वह सांख्य है तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है अर्थात् आत्मामें जन्मादि छहों विकारोंका अभाव होनेके कारण आत्मा अकर्ता है इस प्रकारका जो निश्चय उक्त प्रकरणके अर्थका विवेचन करनेसे उत्पन्न होता है वह सांख्यबुद्धि है वह जिन ज्ञानियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे सांख्ययोगी हैं। इस ( उपर्युक्त ) बुद्धिके उत्पन्न होनेसे पहलेपहले आत्माका देहादिसे पृथक्पन कर्तापन और भोक्तापन माननेकी अपेक्षा रखनेवाला जो धर्मअधर्मके विवेकसे युक्त मार्ग है मोक्षसाधनोंका अनुष्ठान करनेके लिये चेष्टा करना ही जिसका स्वरूप है उसका नाम योग है और तद्विषयक जो बुद्धि है वह योगबुद्धि है वह जिन कर्मियोंके लिये उचित होती है ( जो उसके अधिकारी हैं ) वे योगी हैं। इसी प्रकार भगवान्ने एषा तेऽभिहिता सांख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां श्रृणु इस श्लोकसे अलगअलग दो बुद्धियाँ दिखलायी हैं। उन दोनों बुद्धियोंमेंसे सांख्यबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली सांख्ययोगियोंकी ज्ञानयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको पुरा वेदात्मना मया प्रोक्ता इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। तथा योगबुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाली कर्मयोगसे ( होनेवाली ) निष्ठाको कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इत्यादि वचनोंसे अलग कहेंगे। कर्तापनअकर्तापन और एकताअनेकताजैसी भिन्नभिन्न बुद्धिके आश्रित रहनेवाले जो ज्ञान और कर्म हैं उन दोनोंका एक पुरुषमें होना असम्भव माननेवाले भगवान्ने ही स्वयं उपर्युक्त प्रकारसे सांख्यबुद्धि और योगबुद्धिका आश्रय लेकर अलगअलग दो निष्टाएँ कही हैं। जिस प्रकार ( गीताशास्त्रमें ) इन दोनों निष्ठाओंका अलगअलग वर्णन है वैसे ही शतपथ ब्राह्मणमें भी दिखलाया गया है। ( वहाँ ) इस आत्मलोकको ही चाहनेवाले वैराग्यशील ब्राह्मण संन्यास लेते हैं इस प्रकार सर्वकर्मसंन्यासका विधान करके उसी वाक्यके शेष वाक्यसे कहा है कि जिन हमलोगोंका यह आत्मा ही लोक है ( वे हम ) सन्ततिसे क्या ( सिद्ध ) करेंगे। वहीं यह भी कहा है कि प्राकृत आत्मा अर्थात् अज्ञानी मनुष्य धर्मजिज्ञासाके बाद और विवाहसे पहले तीनों लोकोंकी प्राप्तिके साधनरूप पुत्रकी तथा दैव और मानुष ऐसे दो प्रकारके धनकी इच्छा करने लगा। इनमें पितृलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप कर्म तो मानुष धन है और देवलोककी प्राप्तिका साधनरूप विद्या देवधन है। इस तरह ( उपर्युक्त श्रुतिमें ) अविद्या और कामनावाले पुरुषके लिये ही श्रौतादि सम्पूर्ण कर्म बताये गये हैं। उन सब ( कर्मों ) से निवृत्त होकर संन्यास ग्रहण करते हैं इस कथनसे केवल आत्मलोकको चाहनेवाले निष्कामी पुरुषके लिये संन्यासका ही विधान किया है। यदि ( इसपर भी यह बात मानी जायगी कि ) भगवान्को श्रौतकर्म और ज्ञानका समुच्चय इष्ट है तो यह उपर्युक्त विभक्त विवेचन अयोग्य ठहरेगा। तथा ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते इत्यादि जो अर्जुन का प्रश्न है वह भी नहीं बन सकता। यदि ज्ञान और कर्मका एक पुरुषद्वारा एक साथ किया जाना असम्भव और कर्मकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानका श्रेष्ठत्व भगवान्ने पहले न कहा होता तो इस तरह अर्जुन बिना सुनी हुई बातका झूठे ही भगवान्में अध्यारोप कैसे करता कि ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिः। यदि सभीके लिये ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय कहा होता तो अर्जुनके लिये भी वह कहा ही गया था फिर दोनोंका समुचित उपदेश होते हुए यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम् इस प्रकार दोनोंमेंसे एकके ही सम्बन्धमें प्रश्न कैसे होता क्योंकि पित्तकी शान्ति चाहनेवालेको वैद्यके द्वारा यह उपदेश दिया जानेपर कि मधुर और शीत पदार्थ सेवन करना चाहिये रोगोका यह प्रश्न नहीं बन सकता कि उन दोनोंमेंसे किसी एकको ही पित्तकी शान्तिका उपाय बतलाइये। यदि ऐसी कल्पना की जाय कि भगवान्द्वारा कहे हुए वचन न समझनेके कारण अर्जुनने प्रश्न किया है तो फिर भगवान्को प्रश्नके अनुरूप ही यह उत्तर देना चाहिये था कि मैंने तो ज्ञान और कर्मका समुच्चय बतलाया है तू ऐसा भ्रान्त क्यों हो रहा है परंतु प्रश्नसे विपरीत दूसरा ही उत्तर देना कि मैंने दो निष्ठाएँ पहले कही हैं ( उपर्युक्त कल्पनाके ) उपयुक्त नहीं है। इसके सिवा यदि केवल स्मार्तकर्मके साथ ही ज्ञानका समुच्चय माना जाय तो भी विभक्त वर्णन आदि सब उपयुक्त नहीं ठहरते। तथा ऐसा माननेसे युद्धरूप स्मार्तकर्म क्षत्रियका स्वधर्म है यह जाननेवाले अर्जुनका इस प्रकार उलाहना देना भी नहीं बन सकता कि तत् किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि गीताशास्त्रमें किञ्चिन्मात्र भी श्रौत या स्मार्त किसी भी कर्मके साथ आत्मज्ञानका समुच्चय कोई भी नहीं दिखा सकता। अज्ञानसे या आसक्ित आदि दोषोंसे कर्ममें लगे हुए जिस पुरुषको यज्ञसे दानसे या तपसे अन्तःकरण शुद्ध होकर परमार्थतत्त्वविषयक ऐसा ज्ञान प्राप्त हो जाता है कि यह सब एक ब्रह्म ही है और वह अकर्ता है। उसके कर्ममें कर्म और फल दोनों ही यद्यपि निवृत्त हो चुकते हैं तो भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये पहलेकी भाँति यत्नपूर्वक कर्मोंमें लगे रहनेवाले पुरुषका जो प्रवृत्तिरूप कर्म दिखलायी देता है वह वास्तवमें कर्म नहीं है जिससे कि ज्ञानके साथ उसका समुच्चय हो सके। जैसे भगवान् वासुदेवद्वारा किये हुए क्षात्रकर्मोंका मोक्षकी सिद्धिके लिये ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता वैसे ही फलेच्छा और अहंकारके अभावकी समानता होनेके कारण ज्ञानीके कर्मोंका भी ( ज्ञानके साथ समुच्चय नहीं होता )। क्योंकि आत्मज्ञानी न तो ऐसा ही मानता है कि मैं करता हूँ और न उन कर्मोंका फल ही चाहता है। इसके सिवा जैसे कामसाधनरूप अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका अनुष्ठान करने के लिये सकाम अग्निहोत्रादिमें लगे हुए स्वर्गादिकी कामनावाले अग्निहोत्रीकी कामना यदि आधा कर्म कर चुकनेपर नष्ट हो जाय और फिर भी उसके द्वारा वही अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म होता रहे तो भी वह काम्यकर्म नहीं होता ( वैसे ही ज्ञानीके कर्म भी कर्म नहीं हैं )। कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते न करोति न लिप्यते इत्यादि वचनोंसे भगवान् भी जगहजगह यही बात दिखलाते हैं।    इसके सिवा जो पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः इत्यादि वचन हैं उनको विभागपूर्वक समझना चाहिये। पू0 वह किस प्रकार समझें उ0 यदि वे पूर्वमें होनेवाले जनकादि तत्त्ववेत्ता होकर भी लोकसंग्रहके लिये कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्त थे तब तो यह अर्थ समझना चाहिये कि गुण ही गुणोंमें बरत रहे हैं इस ज्ञानसे ही वे परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए अर्थात् कर्मसंन्यासकी योग्यता प्राप्त होनेपर भी कर्मोंका त्याग नहीं किया कर्म करतेकरते ही परम सिद्धिको प्राप्त हो गये। यदि वे जनकादि तत्त्वज्ञानी नहीं थे तो ऐसी व्याख्या करनी चाहिये कि वे ईश्वरके समर्पण किये हुए साधनरूप कर्मोंद्वारा चित्तशुद्धिरूप सिद्धिको अथवा ज्ञानोत्पत्तिरूप सिद्धिको प्राप्त हुए। यही बात भगवान् कहेंगे कि ( योगी ) अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिके लिये कर्म करते हैं। तथा स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानवः ऐसा कहकर फिर उस सिद्धिप्राप्त पुरुषके लिये सिद्धिं प्राप्तो यथा ब्रह्म इत्यादि वचनोंसे ज्ञाननिष्ठा कहेंगे। सुतरां गीताशास्त्रमें निश्चय किया हुआ अर्थ यही है कि केवल तत्त्वज्ञानसे ही मुक्ित होती है कर्मसहित ज्ञानसे नहीं। जैसा यह भगवान्का अभिप्राय है वैसा ही प्रकरणके अनुसार विभागपूर्वक उनउन स्थानोंपर हम आगे दिखलायेंगे।",
      "English": "2.10 And here, the text commencing from 'But seeing the army of the Pandavas' (1.2) and ending with '(he) verily became silent, telling Him (Govinda), \"I shall not fight\"' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow, delusion, etc. [Delusion means want of discrimination. Etc. stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion, as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these.] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures. Thus indeed, Ajuna's own sorrow and delusion, cuased by the ideas of affection, parting, etc., originating from the erroneous belief, 'I belong to these; they belong to me', with regard to kingdom [See note under verse 8.-Tr.], elders, sons, comrades, well-wishers (1.26), kinsmen (1.37), relatives (1.34) and friends, have been shown by him with the words, 'How can I (fight)৷৷.in battle (against) Bhisma' (4), etc. It is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that, even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the Ksatriyas, he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc. It is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow, delusion, etc. there verily follows, as a matter of course, abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones. Even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech, mind, body, etc., are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards, and are accompanied by egoism. [Egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward.] Such being the case, the cycle of births and deaths characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births, and meeting with happiness, sorrow, etc. [From virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness. From unvirtuous, sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings, and sorrow. From the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being, with a mixture of happiness and sorrow.] from the accumulation of virtue and vice, continues unendingly. Thus, sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths. And their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties. Hence, wishing to impart that (knowledge of the Self) for favouring the whole world, Lord Vasudeva, making Arjuna the medium, said, 'You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. As to that some (opponents) [According to A.G. the opponent is the Vrttikara who, in the opinion of A. Mahadeva Sastri, is none other than Bodhayana referred to in Sankaracarya's commentary on B.S. 1.1.11-19.-Tr.] say: Certainly, Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor. What then? The well-ascertained conclusion of the whole of the Gita is that Liberation is attained through Knowledge associated with rites and duties like Agnihotra etc. prescribed in the Vedas and the Smrtis. And as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'On the other hand, if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (33); 'Your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (47); 'Therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' (4.15), etc. Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc.'. Objection: How? Opponent: The duties of the Ksatriyas, charaterized by war, do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty, even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders, brothers, sons and others. And from the Lord's declaration that when they are not performed, 'then, forsaking your own duty and fame, you will incur sin' (33), it stands out as (His) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as, '(One shall perform Agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc., and actions which involve crutely to animals etc. are not sinful. Vedantin: That is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to Knowledge and to action, which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi). The nature of the Self, the supreme Reality, determined by the Lord in the text beginning with 'Those who are not to be grieved for' (11) and running to the end of the verse, 'Even considering your own duty' (31), is called Sankhya. Sankhya-buddhi [Sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the Vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the Self, the supreme Goal. The Reality under discussion, which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it, is Sankhya.] (Conviction about the Reality) is the conviction with regard to That (supreme Reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [Ascertainment৷৷.of the context, i.e., of the meaning of the verses starting from, 'Never is this One born, and never does It die,' etc. (20).] that the Self is not an agent because of the absence in It of the six kinds of changes, viz birth etc. [Birth, continuance, growth, transformation, decay and death.] Sankhyas are those men of Knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural. Prior to the rise of this Conviction (Sankhya-buddhi), the ascertained [Ast. and A.G. omit this word 'ascertainment, nirupana'-Tr.] of the performance of the disciplines leading to Liberation which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice, [And adoration of God]. and which presupposes the Self's difference from the body etc. and Its agentship and enjoyership is called Yoga. The conviction with regard to that (Yoga) is Yoga-buddhi. The performers of rites and duties, for whom this (conviction) is appropriate, are called yogis. Accordingly, the two distinct Convictions have been pointed out by the Lord in the verse, 'This wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization (Sankhya). But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (Karma-) yoga' (39). And of these two, the Lord will separately speak, with reference to the Sankhyas, of the firm adherence to the Yoga of Knowledge. [Here Yoga and Knowledge are identical. Yoga is that through which one gets connected, identified. with Brahman.] which is based on Sankya-buddhi, in, 'Two kinds of adherences were spoken of by Me in the form of the Vedas, in the days of yore.' [This portion is ascending to G1.Pr. and A.A.; Ast. omits this and otes exactly the first line of 3.3. By saying, 'in the form of the Vedas', the Lord indicates that the Vedas, which are really the knowledge inherent in God and issue out of Him, are identical with Himself.-Tr.] similarly, in, 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), He will separately speak of the firm adherence to the Yoga [Here also Karma and Yoga are identical, and lead to Liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in Knowledge.] of Karma which is based on Yoga-buddhi (Conviction about Yoga). Thus, the two kinds of steadfastness that based on the conviction about the nature of the Self, and that based on the conviction about rites and duties have been distinctly spoken of by the Lord Himself, who saw that the coexistence of Knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person, they being based on the convictions of non-agentship and agentship, unity and diversity (respectively). As is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences), just so has it been revealed in the Satapatha Brahmana: 'Desiring this world (the Self) alone monks and Brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf. Br. 4.4.22). After thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties, it is said in continuation, 'What shall we acheive through childeren, we who have attained this Self, this world (result).' [The earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation, and the second is an arthavada, or an emphasis on that injunction. Arthavada: A sentence which usually recommends a vidhi, or precept, by stating the good arising from its proper observance, and the evils arising from its omission; and also by adducing historical instances in its support.-V.S.A] Again, there itself it is said that, before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [The state of ignorance owing to non-realization of Reality. Such a person is a Brahmacarin, who goes to a teacher for studying the Vedas]. And (then) after his eniries into rites and duties, [The Brahmacarin first studies the Vedas and then enires into their meaning. Leaving his teacher's house after completing his course, he becomes a house holder.] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [This world, the world of manes and heaven.-Tr.] 'desired' (see Br. 1.4.17) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes, and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven. In this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the Vedas etc. are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire. And in the text, 'After renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see Br. 4.4.22), the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the Self, and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else). Now, if the intention of the Lord were the combination of Knowledge with Vedic rites and duties, then this utterance (of the Lord) (3.3) about the distinction would have been illogical. Nor would Arjuna's estion, 'If it be Your opinion that wisdom (Knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷.,' etc. (3.1) be proper. If the Lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of Knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time), then how could Arjuna falsely impute to the Lord by saying, 'If it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷' (of having spoken) what was not heard by him, viz the higher status of Knolwedge over rites and duties? Morevoer, if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all, then it stands enjoined, ipso facto, on Arjuna as well. Therefore, if instruction had been given for practising both, then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in, 'Tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which I may attain the highest Good' (3.2)? Indeed, when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing, there can arise no such reest as, 'Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! Again, if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said, even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me. Why are you confused thus?' On the other hand, it was not proper to have answered, 'Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore,' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion. Nor even do all the statements about distinction etc. become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only. Besides, the accusation in the sentence, 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action' (3.1) becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis. Therefore, it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination, even in the least, of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis. But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment, and then got his mind purified through sacrifices, charities or austerities (see Br. 4.4.22), there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality that all this is but One, and Brahman is not an agent (of any action). With regard to him, although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them, yet, what may, appear as his diligent continuance, just as before, in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge. Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva, in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya, do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (Liberation), similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship. Indeed, a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk 'I am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result. Again, as for instance, person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc. may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra etc. which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast. reading is: Agnihotradi-karma-laksana-dharma-anusthanaya, for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra etc.-Tr.] then, while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra etc. as the means for the desirable things, the desire may get destroyed when the rite is half-done. He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those performance of those very Agnihotra etc.; but those Agnihotra etc. cannot be held to be for this personal gain. Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that, 'even while perfroming actions,' he does not act, 'he does not become tainted' (5.7). As for the texts, '৷৷.as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' (4.15), 'For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself' (3.20), they are to be understood analytically. Objection: How so? Vedantin: As to that, if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality, they did so for preventing people from going astray, while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' (3.28). The idea is this that, though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise, they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties. On the other hand, if they were not knowers of Reality, then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God, Janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge. This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind.] will be expressed by the Lord in, '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (i.e. of the heart, or the mind)' (5.11). After having said, 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties' [By performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God, one's mind becomes purified. Then, through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge. From that steadfatness follows Liberation. Therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation. (See Common. under 5.12) (18.46), He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success, in the text, '(Understand৷৷.from Me৷৷.that process by which) one who has achieved success attains Brahman' (18.50). So, the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality, and not from its combination with action. And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction, we shall show how this conclusion stands. That being so, Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna, whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast. and A.A., have an additional word mithyajnanavatah, meaning 'who had false ignorance'.-Tr.] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow, there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self. And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that, He said, '(You grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for,' etc. by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self. [In this Gita there are three distinct parts, each part consisting of six chapters. These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying, 'Tattvamasi, thou art That', with a view to finding out their real meanings. The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou); the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that); and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat. The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places.]"

      "English": "2.9 - 2.10 Sanjaya said Thus, the Lord, the Supreme Person, introduced the Sastra regarding the self for the sake of Arjuna - whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation, who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (Ksatriyas), and who took refuge in Sri Krsna to know what his right duty was -, thinking that Arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self, and that war was an ordained duty here which, when freed from attachment to fruits, is a means for self-knowledge. Thus, has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna, whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness, and who took refuge in Sri Krsna.' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling, and looking at Arjuna, who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self, but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body, and while he (Arjuna), torn between contradictory ideas, had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight. Sri Krsna said, as if in ridicule, to Arjuna the words beginning with, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II. 12), and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII. 66) - which have for their contents the real nature of the self, of the Supreme Self, and of the paths of work (Karma), knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment."

(Br. 3.5.1) ['Therefore the knowers of Brahman, having known all about scholorship, should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having known all about this strength as well as scholorship, he becomes meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite, he becomes a knower of Brahman.'] ; na anusocanti, do not grieve for; gatasun, the departed, whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca, and for those who have not departed, whose life has not left, the living. The ideas is, 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense, and who are not to be grieved for. Hence your are a fool!.'"

      "English": "2.11 The Lord said You are grieving for those who do not deserve to be grieved for. You also speak words of wisdom about the nature of the body and the self as follows: 'The ancestors fall degraded, deprived of the ritual oblations of food and water' (I. 42). There is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self. Those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed. They do not grieve for bodies or souls. Hence, in you this contradiction is visible - your grief at the thought 'I shall slay them?' and at the same time your talk about righteousness and unrighteousness, as if it were the result of knowledge of the self as distinct from the body. Therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal. Nor do you know of duties like war etc., which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self, nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context), if fought without any selfish desire for results, is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self. The implied meaning is this: This self, verily, is not dependent on the body for Its existence, nor is It subjected to destruction on the death of the body, as there is no birth or death for It. Therefore there is no cause for grief. But the body is insentient by nature, is subject to change, and its birth and death are natural; thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for. First listen about the nature of the self."

      "English": "2.12 Indeed, I, the Lord of all, who is eternal, was never non-existent, but existed always. It is not that these selves like you, who are subject to My Lordship, did not exist; you have always existed. It is not that 'all of us', I and you, shall cease to be 'in the future', i.e., beyond the present time; we shall always exist. Even as no doubt can be entertainted that I, the Supreme Self and Lord of all, am eternal, likewise, you (Arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves, also should be considered eternal. The foregoing implies that the difference between the Lord, the sovereign over all, and the individual selves, as also the differences among the individual selves themselves, are real. This has been declared by the Lord Himself. For, different terms like 'I', 'you', 'these', 'all' and 'we' have been used by the Lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of Arjuna who is deluded by ignorance. [Now follows a refutation of the Upadhi theory of Bhaskara and the Ignorance theory of the Advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the Lord and the Jivas.] If we examine (Bhaskara's) theory of Upadhis (adjuncts), which states that the apparent differences among Jivas are due to adjuncts, it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth, because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality. But that the differences mentioned by the Lord are natural, is taught by the Sruti also: 'Eternal among eternals, sentient among sentients, the one, who fulfils the desires of the many' (Sve. U. VI. 13, Ka. U. V. 13). The meaning of the text is: Among the eternal sentient beings who are countless, He, who is the Supreme Spirit, fulfils the desires of all.' As regards the theory of the Advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real, the Supreme Being - whose vision must be true and who, therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the Atman in all authenticity, and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects - cannot possibly perceive the so-called difference arising from ignornace. It is, therefore, unimaginable that He engages himself in activities such as teaching, which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance. The argument that the Supreme Being, though possessed of the understanding of nom-duality, can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation, just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth, and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage - such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind, namely, the perception of the mirage, which, when understood to be what it is, does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom. In the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the non-dualistic illumination persists, it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching; for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal. The idea is that just as the discovery of the non-existence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it, so also when all duality is sublated by illumination, no activity like teaching disciples etc., can take place. Nor can the Lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures, and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences. Such a position would stand in contradiction to the Sruti and the Smrti: 'He, who is all-comprehender' (Mun. U., 1. 1. 9); all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in Srutis, such as knowledge, strength and action' (Sve. U. 6. 8); 'I know, Arjuna, all beings of the past, present and future but no one knows Me,' etc. (Gita 7. 26). And again, if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary Self has been decisively understood, the estion will arise - to whom will the Lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding? The estion needs an answer. The idea is that knowledge of non-duality and perception of differences cannot co-exist. If it be replied by Advaitins holding the Bimba-Pratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as Arjuna, it would amount to an absurdity. For, no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone, the blade of a sword or a mirror, knowing, as he does, that they are non-different from himself. The theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain, as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted. 'The persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons, where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight, nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon. Even though the perception of the two moons may continue, the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence. For, it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience. But in the present context (i.e. the Advaitic), the conception of difference, whose object and cause are admittedly unreal, is cancelled by the knowledge of reality. So the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen. Thus, if the Supreme Lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (Non-dual) reality, their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception, are impossible. If, on the other hand, the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause, then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth, and they will be incapable of teaching the truth. Further, as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning Brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated, there is no purpose in instructing the disciple. It it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple, the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor, and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion. If it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc., because it contradicts the antecedent state of non-enlightenment, the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge. The futility of such teachings is obvious. Enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted."

To get rid of this bondage (of bodies), embodied beings perform duties like war appropriate to their stations in life with the help of the same bodies in an attitude of detachment from the fruits as prescribed by the scripture. Even to such aspirants, contacts with sense-objects give pleasure and pain, arising from cold, heat and such other things. But these experiences are to be endured till the acts enjoined in the scriptures come to an end. The Lord explains the significance immediately afterwards:"

Asatah, of the unreal, of cold, heat, etc. together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being, existence, reality; because heat, cold, etc. together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof. For they are changeful, and whatever is changeful is inconstant. As configurations like pot etc. are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes, so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes, and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction. Objection: If it be that [Here Ast. has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh, the effect, viz pot etc. (and)'.-Tr.] such (material) causes as earth etc. as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes, in that case, may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [An entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is non-different from its cause. Were it to be asserted as being unreal, then the cause also should be unreal, because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect.]? Vedantin: No, for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses, viz the awareness of reality, and the awareness of unreality. [In all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable, and the other is variable. Since the variable is imagined on the invariable, therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination, and which is neither a cause nor an effect.] That in relation to which the awareness does not change is real; that in relation to which it changes is unreal. Thus, since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness, therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (As for instance, the experiences) 'The pot is real', 'The cloth is real', 'The elephant is real' (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'A blue lotus'. [In the empirical experience, 'A blue lotus', there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities, viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness). In the case of the experience, 'The pot is real', etc. the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities, but the awareness of pot,of cloth, etc. are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality', like that of 'water' in a mirage.] This is how it happens everywhere. [The coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc. are valid only empirically according to the non-dualists; whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists.] Of these two awareness, the awareness of pot etc. is inconstant; and thus has it been shown above. But the awareness of reality is not (inconstant). Therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc. is unreal because of inconstancy; but not so the object of the awareness of reality, because of its constancy. Objection: If it be argued that, since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed, therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful? Vedantin: No, because in cloth etc. the awareness of reality is seen to persist. That awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot'). For this reason also it is not destroyed. [This last sentence has been cited in the f.n. of A.A.-Tr.] Objection: If it be argued that like the awareness of reality, the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots? Vedantin: No, because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc. Objection: May it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed? Vedantin: No, because the noun is absent (there). Since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (i.e. it is used adjectivelly), therefore, when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective. So, to what should it relate? But, again, the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [Even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it, the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed. Some read nanu in place of na tu ('But, again'). In that case, the first portion (No,৷৷.since৷৷.adjective. So,৷৷.relate?) is a statement of the Vedantin, and the Objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh, etc. so, the next Objection will run thus: 'May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, the awareness of existence has no noun to alify, and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'-Tr.] Objection: May it not be said that, when nouns like pot etc. are absent, (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [The relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities. Therefore, if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective, then both of them will be real entities. So, the coexistence of reality with a non-pot does not stand to reason.] Vedantin: No, because in such experiences as, 'This water exists', (which arises on seeing a mirage etc.) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is non-existent. Therefore, asatah, of the unreal, viz body etc. and the dualities (heat, cold, etc.), together with their causes; na vidyate, there is no; bhavah, being. And similarly, satah, of the real, of the Self; na vidyate, there is no; abhavah, nonexistence, because It is constant everywhere. This is what we have said. Tu, but; antah, the nature, the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the Real is verily real, and the unreal is verily unreal; ubhayoh api, of both these indeed, of the Self and the non-Self, of the Real and the unreal, as explained above; drstah, has been realized thus; tattva-darsibhih, by the seers of Truth. Tat is a pronoun (Sarvanama, lit. name of all) which can be used with regard to all. And all is Brahman. And Its name is tat. The abstraction of tat is tattva, the true nature of Brahman. Those who are apt to realize this are tattva-darsinah, seers of Truth. Therefore, you too, by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion, forbear the dualities, heat, cold, etc. some of which are definite in their nature, and others inconstant , mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful, verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage. This is the idea. What, again, is that reality which remains verily as the Real and surely for ever? This is being answered in, 'But know That', etc."

      "English": "2.16 'The unreal,' that is, the body, can never come into being. 'The real,' that is, the self, can never cease to be. The finale about these, the body and the self, which can be experienced, has been realised correctly by the seers of the Truth. As analyis ends in conclusion, the term 'finale' is here used. The meaning is this: Non-existence (i.e., perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient. Existence (i.e., imperishableness) is the real nature of the self, which is sentient. [What follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being.'] Non-existence has, indeed, the nature of perishableness, and existence has the nature of imperishableness, as Bhagavan Parasara has said: 'O Brahmana, apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time. Thus have I taught you what is real existence - how conscious entity is real, and all else is unreal' (V. P., 2.12.43 - 45). 'The Supreme Reality is considered as imperishable by the wise. There is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (Ibid., 2.14.24). 'That entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc., is real. What is that entity, O King? (It is the self who retains Its knowledge)' (Ibid., 2.13.100). It is said here also: 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18) and 'Know That (the Atman) to be indestructible' (2.17). It is seen from this that this (i.e., perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the Atman as 'existence' (Sattva) and body as 'non-existence' (Asvattva). This verse has no reference to the doctrine of Satkaryavada (i.e., the theory that effects are present in the cause), as such a theory has no relevance here. Arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self; so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion, is discrimination between these two - what is alified by perishablenss and what, by imperishableness. This (declaration) is introduced in the following way: 'For the dead, or for the living' (2.11). Again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words), 'Know that to be indestructible ৷৷.' (2.17) and 'These bodies ৷৷. are said to have an end' (2.18). How the imperishableness of the self is to be understood, Sri Krsna now teaches:"

      "English": "2.18 Ime, these; antavantah, destructible; dehah, bodies as the idea of reality which continues with regard to water in a mirage, etc. gets eliminated when examined with the means of knowledge, and that is its end, so are these bodies and they have an end like bodies etc. in dream and magic ; uktah, are said, by discriminating people; to belong nityasya, to the everlasting; anasinah, the indestructible; aprameyasya, the indeterminable; sarirnah, embodied One, the Self. This is the meaning. The two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' are not repetitive, because in common usage everlastingness and destructibility are of two kinds. As for instance, a body which is reduced to ashes and has disappeared is said to have been destoryed. (And) even while existing, when it becomes transfigured by being afflicted with diseases etc. it is said to be 'destroyed'. [Here the A.A. adds 'tatha dhana-nase-apyevam, similar is the case even with regard to loss of wealth.'-Tr.] That being so, by the two words 'everlasting' and 'indestructible' it is meant that It is not subject to both kinds of distruction. Otherwise, the everlastingness of the Self would be like that of the earth etc. Therefore, in order that this contingency may not arise, it is said, 'Of the everlasting, indestructible'. Aprameyasya, of the indeterminable, means 'of that which cannot be determined by such means of knowledge as direct perception etc.' Objection: Is it not that the Self is determined by the scriptures, and before that through direct perception etc.? Vedantin: No, because the Self is self-evident. For, (only) when the Self stands predetermined as the knower, there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower. Indeed, it is not that without first determining oneself as, 'I am such', one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge. For what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone. But the scripture is the final authority [when the Vedic text establishes Brahman as the innermost Self, all the distinctions such as knower, known and the means of knowledge become sublated. Thus it is reasonable that the Vedic text should be the final authority. Besides, its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being.]: By way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the Self, it attains authoritativeness with regard to the Self, but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known. There is an Upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷.the Brahman that is immediate and direct, the Self that is within all' (Br. 3.4.1). Since the Self is thus eternal and unchanging, tasmat, therefore; yudhyasva, you join the battle, i.e. do not desist from the war. Here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty, because be (Arjuna), though he was determined for war, remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion. Therefore, all that is being done by the Lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty. 'Therefore, join the battle' is only an approval, not an injunction. The scripture Gita is intended for eradicating sorrow, delusion, etc. which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths; it is not intended to enjoin action. As evidences of this idea the Lord cites two Vedic verses: [Ka. 1.2.19-20. There are slight verbal differences.-Tr.]"

For, jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end. The bodies of the embodied self, which are made of conglomerated elements, serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of Karmas, as stated in Brh. U. IV. 4.5, 'Auspicious embodiments are got through good actions.' Such bodies perish when Karmas are exhausted. Further the self is imperishable. Why? Because it is not measurable. Neither can It be conceived as the object of knowledge, but only as the subject (knower). It will be taught later on: 'He who knows It is called the knower of the Field by those who know this (13.1). Besides, the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements). Because in the perception 'I am the knower' throughout the body, only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower. Further, this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body. Therefore the self is eternal, for (1) It is not a complex being of a single form; (2) It is the knowing subject; and (3) It pervades all. On the contrary, the body is perishable, because (1) it is complex; (2) it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of Karma by the embodied self; (3) it has a plurality of parts and (4) it can be pervaded. Therefore, as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal, both are not objects fit for grief. Hence, bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons, sharp or hard, liable to be received by you and others, begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality."

The A.A. has this phrase in both the places.-Tr.] as 'I am the killer', and he who thinks, 'I have been killed', both of them are ignorant of the nature of the Self. For, ayam, this Self; owing to Its changelessness, na hanti, does not kill, does not become the agent of the act of killing; na hanyate, nor is It killed, i.e. It does not become the object (of the act of killing). The second verse is to show how the Self is changeless:"

      "English": "2.20 Na kadacit, neverl; is ayam, this One; jayate, born i.e. the Self has no change in the form of being born to which matter is subject ; va, and ( va is used in the sense of and); na mriyate, It never dies. By this is denied the final change in the form of destruction. The word (na) kadacit), never, is connected with the denial of all kinds of changes thus never, is It born never does It die, and so on. Since ayam, this Self; bhutva, having come to exist, having experienced the process of origination; na, will not; bhuyah, again; abhavita, cease to be thereafter, therefore It does not die. For, in common parlance, that which ceases to exist after coming into being is said to die. From the use of the word va, nor, and na, it is understood that, unlike the body, this Self does not again come into existence after having been non-existent. Therefore It is not born. For, the words, 'It is born', are used with regard to something which comes into existence after having been non-existent. The Self is not like this. Therfore It is not born. Since this is so, therefore It is ajah, birthless; and since It does not die, therefore It is nityah, eternal. Although all changes become negated by the denial of the first and the last kinds of changes, still changes occuring in the middle [For the six kinds of changes see note under verse 2.10.-Tr.] should be denied with their own respective terms by which they are implied. Therefore the text says sasvatah, undecaying,. so that all the changes, viz youth etc., which have not been mentioned may become negated. The change in the form of decay is denied by the word sasvata, that which lasts for ever. In Its own nature It does not decay because It is free from parts. And again, since it is without alities, there is no degeneration owing to the decay of any ality. Change in the form of growth, which is opposed to decay, is also denied by the word puranah, ancient. A thing that grows by the addition of some parts is said to increase and is also said to be new. But this Self was fresh even in the past due to Its partlessness. Thus It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is puranah, i.e. It does not grow. So also, na hanyate, It is not killed, It does not get transformed; even when sarire, the body; hanyamane, is killed, transformed. The verb 'to kill' has to be understood here in the sense of transformation, so that a tautology [This verse has already mentioned 'death' in the first line. If the verb han, to kill, is also taken in the sense of killing, then a tautology is unavoidable.-Tr.] may be avoided. In this mantra the six kinds of transformations, the material changes seen in the world, are denied in the Self. The meaning of the sentence is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of changes. Since this is so, therefore 'both of them do not know' this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra."

In this connection, as the statement, 'It is never born, It never dies' is in the present tense, it should be understood that the birth and death which are experienced by all in all bodies, do not touch the self. The statement 'Having come into being once, It never ceases to be' means that this self, having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (i.e., will emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated). This is the meaning - that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies such as those of Brahman and others, and death at the end of a Kalpa as stated in the scriptures, do not touch the self. Hence, the selves in all bodies, are unborn, and therefore eternal. It is abiding, not connected, like matter, with invisible modifications taking place. It is primeval; the meaning is that It existed from time immemorial; It is even new i.e., It is capable of being experienced always as fresh. Therefore, when the body is slain the self is not slain."

हुए अर्थका उपसंहार करते हैं पूर्व मन्त्रमें कहे हुए लक्षणोंसे युक्त इस आत्माको जो अविनाशी अन्तिम भावविकाररूप मरणसे रहित नित्य रोगादिजनित दुर्बलता क्षीणता आदि विकारोंसे रहित अज जन्मरहित और अव्यय अपक्षयरूप विकारसे रहित जानता है। \n वह आत्मतत्त्वका ज्ञाताअधिकारी पुरुष कैसे ( किसको ) मारता है और कैसे ( किसको ) मरवाता है अर्थात् वह कैसे तो हननरूप क्रिया कर सकता और कैसे किसी मारनेवालेको नियुक्त कर सकता है अभिप्राय यह कि वह न किसीको किसी प्रकार भी मारता है और न किसीको किसी प्रकार भी मरवाता है। इन दोनों बातोंमे किम् और कथम् शब्द आक्षेपके बोधक हैं क्योंकि प्रश्नके अर्थमें यहाँ इनका प्रयोग सम्भव नहीं। निर्विकारतारूप हेतुका तात्पर्य सभी कर्मोंका प्रतिषेध करनेमें समान है इससे इस प्रकरणका अर्थ भगवान्को यही इष्ट है कि आत्मवेत्ता किसी भी कर्मका करने करवानेवाला नहीं होता। अकेली हननक्रियाके विषयमें आक्षेप करना उदाहरणके रूपमें है। \n पू O कर्म न हो सकनेमें कौनसे खास हेतुको देखकर ज्ञानीके लिये भगवान् कथं स पुरुषः इस कथनसे कर्मविषयक आक्षेप करते हैं \n उ O पहले ही कह आये हैं कि आत्माकी निर्विकारता ही ( ज्ञानीकर्तृक ) सम्पूर्ण कर्मोंके न होनेका खास हेतु है। \n पू O कहा है सही परंतु अविक्रिय आत्मासे उसको जाननेवाला भिन्न है इसलिये ( यह ऊपर बतलाया हुआ ) खास कारण उपयुक्त नहीं है क्योंकि स्थाणुको अविक्रिय जाननेवालेसे कर्म नहीं होते ऐसा नहीं ऐसी शङ्का करें तो \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्मा स्वयं ही जाननेवाला है। देह आदि संघातमें ( जड होनेके कारण ) ज्ञातापन नहीं हो सकता इसलिये अन्तमें देहादि संघातसे भिन्न आत्मा ही अविक्रिय ठहरता है और वही जाननेवाला है। ऐसे उस ज्ञानीसे कर्म होना असम्भव है अतः कथं स पुरुष यह आक्षेप उचित ही है। \n जैसे ( वास्तवमें ) निर्विकार होनेपर भी आत्मा बुद्धिवृत्ति और आत्माका भेदज्ञान न रहनेके कारण अविद्याके सम्बन्धसे बुद्धि आदि इन्द्रियोंद्वारा ग्रहण किये हुए शब्दादि विषयोंका ग्रहण करनेवाला मान लिया जाता है। ऐसे ही आत्मअनात्मविषयक विवेकज्ञानरूप जो बुद्धिवृत्ति है जिसे विद्या कहते हैं वह यद्यपि असत्रूप है तो भी उसके सम्बन्धसे वास्तव में जो अविकारी है ऐसा आत्मा ही विद्वान् कहा जाता है। ज्ञानीके लिये सभी कर्म असम्भव बतलाये हैं इस कारण भगवान्का यह निश्चय समझा जाता है कि शास्त्रद्वारा जिन कर्मोंका विधान किया गया है वे सब अज्ञानियोंके लिये ही विहित हैं। \n पू O विद्या भी अज्ञानीके लिये ही विहित है क्योंकि जिसने विद्याको जान लिया उसके लिये पिसेको पीसनेकी भाँति विद्याका विधान व्यर्थ है। अतः अज्ञानीके लिये कर्म कहे गये हैं ज्ञानीके लिये नहीं इस प्रकार विभाग करना नहीं बन सकता। \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि कर्तव्यके भाव और अभावसे भिन्नता सिद्ध होती है अभिप्राय यह कि अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंका विधान करनेवाले विधिवाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद अनेक साधन और उपसंहारके सहित अमुक अग्निहोत्रादि कर्म अनुष्ठान करनेके योग्य है मैं कर्ता हूँ मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है इस प्रकार जाननेवाले अज्ञानीके लिये जैसे कर्तव्य बना रहता है वैसे न जायते इत्यादि आत्मस्वरूपका विधान करनेवाले वाक्योंके अर्थको जान लेनेके बाद उस ज्ञानीके लिये कुछ कर्तव्य शेष नहीं रहता। क्योंकि ( ज्ञानीको ) मैं न कर्ता हूँ न भोक्ता हूँ इत्यादि जो आत्माके एकत्व और अकर्तृत्व आदिविषयक ज्ञान है इससे अतिरिक्त अन्य किसी प्रकारका भी ज्ञान नहीं होता। इस प्रकार यह ( ज्ञानी और अज्ञानीके कर्तव्यका ) विभाग सिद्ध होता है। जो अपनेको ऐसा समझता है कि मैं कर्ता हूँ उसकी यह बुद्धि अवश्य ही होगी कि मेरा अमुक कर्तव्य है उस बुद्धिकी अपेक्षासे वह कर्मोंका अधिकारी होता है इसीसे उसके लिये कर्म हैं। और उभौ तौ न विजानीतः इस वचनके अनुसार वही अज्ञानी है। क्योंकि पूर्वोक्त विशेषणोंद्वारा वर्णित ज्ञानीके लिये तो कथं स पुरुषः इस प्रकार कर्मोंका निषेध करनेवाले वचन हैं। सुतरां ( यह सिद्ध हुआ कि ) आत्माको निर्विकार जाननेवाले विशिष्ट विद्वान्का और मुमुक्षुका भी सर्वकर्मसंन्यासमें ही अधिकार है। इसीलिये भगवान् नारायण ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् इस कथनसे सांख्ययोगी ज्ञानियों और कर्मी अज्ञानियोंका विभाग करके अलगअलग दो निष्ठा ग्रहण करवाते हैं। ऐसे ही अपने पुत्रसे भगवान् वेदव्यासजी कहते हैं कि ये दो मार्ग हैं इत्यादि तथा यह भी कहते हैं कि पहले क्रियामार्ग और पीछे संन्यास। इसी विभागको बारंबार भगवान् दिखलायेंगे। जैसे अहंकारसे मोहित हुआ अज्ञानी मैं कर्ता हूँ ऐसे मानता है तत्त्ववेत्ता मैं नहीं करता ऐसे मानता है तथा सब कर्मोंका मनसे त्यागकर रहता है इत्यादि। इस विषयमें कितने ही अपनेको पण्डित समझनेवाले कहते हैं कि जन्मादि छः भावविकारोंसे रहित निर्विकार अकर्ता एक आत्मा मैं ही हूँ ऐसा ज्ञान किसीको होता ही नहीं कि जिसके होनेसे सर्वकर्मोंके संन्यासका उपदेश किया जा सके। यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) न जायते इत्यादि शास्त्रका उपदेश व्यर्थ होगा। उनसे यह पूछना चाहिये कि जैसे शास्त्रोपदेशकी सामर्थ्यसे कर्म करनेवाले मनुष्यको धर्मके अस्तित्वका ज्ञान और देहान्तरकी प्राप्तिका ज्ञान होता है उसी तरह उसी पुरुषको शास्त्रसे आत्माकी विर्विकारता अकर्तृत्व और एकत्व आदिका विज्ञान क्यों नहीं हो सकता यदि वे कहें कि ( मनबुद्धि आदि ) करणोंसे आत्मा अगोचर है इस कारण ( उसका ज्ञान नहीं हो सकता )। तो यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि मनके द्वारा उस आत्माको देखना चाहिये यह श्रुति है अतः शास्त्र और आचार्यके उपदेशद्वारा एवं शम दम आदि साधनोंद्वारा शुद्ध किया हुआ मन आत्मदर्शनमें करण ( साधन ) है। इस प्रकार उस ज्ञानप्राप्तिके विषयमें अनुमान और आगमप्रमाणोंके रहते हुए भी यह कहना कि ज्ञान नहीं होता साहसमात्र है। यह तो मान ही लेना चाहिये कि उत्पन्न हुआ ज्ञान अपनेसे विपरीत अज्ञानको अवश्य नष्ट कर देता है। वह अज्ञान मैं मारनेवाला हूँ मैं मारा गया हूँ ऐसे मारनेवाले दोनों नहीं जानते इन वचनोंद्वारा पहले दिखलाया ही था फिर यहाँ भी यह बात दिखायी गयी है कि आत्मामें हननक्रियाका कर्तृत्व कर्मत्व और हेतुकर्तृत्व अज्ञानजनति है। आत्मा निर्विकार होनेके कारण कर्तृत्व आदि भावोंका अविद्यामूलक होना सभी क्रियाओंमे समान है। क्योंकि विकारवान् ही ( स्वयं ) कर्ता ( बनकर ) अपने कर्मरूप दूसरेको कर्ममें नियुक्त करता है कि तू अमुक कर्म कर। सुतरां ज्ञानीका कर्मोंमें अधिकार नहीं है यह दिखानेके लिये भगवान् वेदाविनाशिनम् कथं स पुरुषः इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सभी क्रियाओंमें समान भावसे विद्वान्के कर्ता और प्रयोजक कर्ता होनेका प्रतिषेध करते हैं। ज्ञानीका अधिकार किसमें है यह तो ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानाम् इत्यादि वचनोंद्वारा पहले ही बतलाया जा चुका है वैसे ही फिर भी सर्वकर्माणि मनसा इत्यादि वाक्योंसे सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास ( भगवान् ) कहेंगे। \n पू O ( उक्त श्लोकमें ) मनसा यह शब्द है इसलिये मानसिक कर्मोंका ही त्याग बतलाया है शरीर और वाणीसम्बन्धी कर्मोंका नहीं। \n उ O यह कहना ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि सर्व कर्मोंको छोड़कर इस प्रकार कर्मोंके साथ सर्व विशेषण है। \n पू O यदि मनसम्बन्धी सर्व कर्मोंका त्याग मान लिया जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि वाणी और शरीरकी क्रिया मनोव्यापारपूर्वक ही होती है। मनोव्यापारके अभावमें उनकी क्रिया बन नहीं सकती। \n पू O शास्त्रविहित कायिकवाचिक कर्मोंके कारणरूप मानसिक कर्मोंके सिवा अन्य सब कर्मोंका मनसे संन्यास करना चाहिये यह मान लिया जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि न करता हुआ और न करवाता हुआ यह विशेषण साथमें है ( इसलिये तीनों तरह कर्मोंका संन्यास सिद्ध होता है। ) \n पू O यह भगवान्द्वारा कहा हुआ सर्व कर्मोंका संन्यास तो मुमूर्षु के लिये है जीते हुएके लिये नहीं यह माना जाय तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं। क्योंकि ऐसा मान लेनेसे नौ द्वारवाले शरीररूप पुरमें आत्मा रहता है इस विशेषणकी उपयोगिता नहीं रहती। कारण जो सर्वकर्मसंन्यास करके मर चुका है उसका न करते हुए और न करवाते हुए उस शरीरमें रहना सम्भव नहीं। \n पू O उक्त वाक्यमें शरीरमें कर्मोंको रखकर इस तरह सम्बन्ध है शरीरमें रहता है इस प्रकार सम्बन्ध नहीं है ऐसा मानें तो \n उ O ठीक नहीं है। क्योंकि सभी जगह आत्माको निर्विकार माना गया है। तथा आसन क्रियाको आधारकी अपेक्षा है और संन्यास को उसकी अपेक्षा नहीं है एवं स पूर्वक न्यास शब्दका अर्थ यहाँ त्यागना। है निक्षेप ( रख देना ) नहीं। सुतरां गीताशास्त्रमें आत्मज्ञानीका संन्यासमें ही अधिकार है कर्मोंमें नहीं। यही बात आगे चलकर आत्मज्ञानके प्रकरणमें हम जगहजगह दिखलायेंगे।",
      "English": "2.21 In the mantra, 'He who thinks of this One as the killer,' having declared that (the Self) does not become the agent or the object of the actof killing, and then in the mantra, 'Never is this One born,' etc., having stated the reasons for (Its) changelessness, the Lord sums up the purport of what was declared above: He who knows this One as indestructible, etc. Yah, he who; veda, knows yah is to be thus connected with Veda ; enam, this One, possessing the characteristics stated in the earlier mantra; as avinasinam, indestructible, devoid of the final change of state; nityam, eternal, devoid of transformation; ajam, birthless; and avyayam, undecaying; katham, how, in what way; (and kam, whom;) does sah, that man of realization; purusah, the person who is himself an authority [i.e. above all injunctions and prohibitions. See 18.16.17.-Tr.]; hanti, kill, undertake the act of killing; or how ghatayati, does he cause (others) to be killed, (how does he) instigate a killer! The intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying, 'In no way does he kill any one, nor does he cause anyone to be killed', because an interrogative sense is absurd (here). Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing etc. is the changelessness of the Self, and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realization.-Tr.], viz the immutability of the Self, [The A.A. omits 'viz the immutability of the Self'.-Tr.] is common (with regard to all actions), therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context. But the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example. Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying, 'How can that person,' etc.? Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this word.-Tr.] , the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground, for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self. Indeed, may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! Vedantin: No, because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self. Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses. Therefore, as the last laternative, the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate. Thus, action being impossible for that man of Knowledge, the denial in, 'How can that person৷৷.,' etc. is reasonable. As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect, the Self, though verily immutable, is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc. presented by the intellect etc., in this very way, the Self, which in reality is immutable, is said to be the 'knower' because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and non-Self, which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [By buddhi-vrtti, modification of the intellect, is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object, along with its past impressions, the senses concerned, etc., like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object. Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object, is called objective knowledge. Thery, due to ignorance, the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti, modification. (-A.G.) The process is elsewhere described as follows: The vrtti goes out through the sense-organ concerned, like the flash of a torchlight, and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness. Both of them envelop the object, a pot for instance. The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness, becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot, reveals the pot. In the case of knowledge of Brahman, it is admitted that the vrtti in the form, 'I am Brahman', does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman, but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a 'pot', for Brahman is self-effulgent.-Tr.] and is unreal by nature. From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that, actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened. Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For, the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless, like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so, the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened, and not for the enlightened one, does not stand to reason. Vedantin: No. There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed. As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra etc. their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks, 'Agnihotra etc. has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent, and this is my duty', unlike this, nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self, his non-agency, etc., in the form, 'I am not the agent, I am not the enjoyer', etc., no other idea arises. Thus, this distinction can be maintained. Again, for anyone who knows himself as, 'I am the agent', there will necessarily arise the idea, 'This is my duty.' In relation to that he becomes eligible. In this way duties are (enjoined) [Ast. adds 'sambhavanti, become possible'.-Tr.] for him. And according to the text, 'both of them do not know' (19), he is an unenlightened man. And the text, 'How can that person,' etc. concerns the enlightened person distinguished above, becuase of the negation of action (in this text). Therefore, the enlightened person distinguished above, who has realized the immutable Self, and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties. Therefore, indeed, the Lord Narayana, making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties, makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3). Similarly also, Vyasa said to his son, 'Now, there are these two paths,' etc. ['Now, there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based. They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties, and that by renunciation of them' (Mbh. Sa. 241.6).-Tr.] So also (there is a Vedic text meaning): 'The path of rites and duties, indeed, is the earlier, and renunciation comes after that.' [Ast. says that this is not a otation, but only gives the purport of Tai, Ar. 10.62.12.-Tr.] The Lord will show again and again this very division: 'The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: \"I am the doer\"; but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks, \"I do not act\"' (cf. 3.27,28). So also there is the text, '(The embodied man of selfcontrol,) having given up all actions mentally, continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' (5.13) etc. With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea, 'I am the changeless, actionless Self, which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject', on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined. That is not correct, because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as, 'Never is this One born,' etc. (20). They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies, similarly, why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability, non-agentship, oneness, etc. of that very Self? Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)? Vedantin: No, because the Sruti says, 'It is to be realized through the mind alone, (following the instruction of the teacher)' (Br. 4.4.19). The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher, control of the body and organs, etc. becomes the instrument for realizing the Self. Again, since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization, it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not arise. And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises, it surely eliminates ignorance, its opposite. And that ignorance has been shown in, 'I am the killer', 'I am killed', and 'both of them do not know' (see 2.19). And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent, the object of an action, or an indirect agent, is the result of ignorance. Also, the Self being changeless, the fact that such agentship etc. are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception, because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on, saying, 'Do this.' Thus, with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person, the Lord [Ast, adds vasudeva after 'Lord'.-Tr.] says, 'He who knows this One as indestructible,' 'how can that person,' etc. thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception. As regards the estion, 'For what, again, is the man of enlightenment alified?', the answer has already been give earlier in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization' (3.3). Similarly, the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in, 'having given up all actions mentally,' etc.(5.13). Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression, 'mentally', (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? Vedantin: No, because of the categoric expression, 'all actions'. Objection: May it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind? Vedantin: No, because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind, for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity. Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? Vedantin: No, because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (5.13). Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions, as stated by the Lord, is with regard to a dying man, not one living? Vedantin: No, because (in that case) the specific statement, 'The embodied man৷৷.continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid.) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person, who neither acts nor makes others act, [The words 'akurvatah akarayatah, (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act', have been taken as a part of the Commentator's arguement. But A.G. points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection. In that, case, the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is Neither doing nor making others do, he rest by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions. Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is, '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya, by renouncing) in the body', (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷.'? Vedantin: No, because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless. Besides, the action of 'resting' reires a location, whereas renunciation is independent of this. The word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation', not 'depositing'. Therefore, according to this Scripture, viz the Gita, the man of realization is eligible for renunciation, alone, not for rites and duties. This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self. And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that, the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well.] of the Self, has been postulated. What is it like? That is being said in, 'As after rejecting wornout clothes,' etc."

      "English": "2.21 He who knows the self to be eternal, as It is indestructible, unborn and changeless - how can that person be said to cause the death of the self, be it of the self existing in the bodies of gods or animals or immovables? Whom does he kill? The meaning is - how can he destroy any one or cause anyone to slay? How does he become an instrument for slaying? The meaning is this: the feeling of sorrow: 'I cause the slaying of these selves, I slay these,' has its basis solely in ignorance about the true nature of the self. Let it be granted that what is done is only separation of the bodies from the eternal selves. Even then, when the bodies, which are instruments for the experience of agreeable pleasures, perish, there still exists reason for sorrow in their separation from the bodies.

When arranged in a particular way, they are called clothes etc. It is seen that even those who uphold the doctrine that the effect is a new entity (Asatkarya-vadins) will admit this much that no new entity over and above the particular arrangement of threads is seen. It is not tenable to hold that this is the coming into being of a new entity, since, by the process of manufacture there is only attainment of a new name and special functions. No new entity emerges. Origination, annihilation etc., are thus particular stages of an existent entity. With regard to an entity which has entered into a stage known as origination, its entry into the opposite condition is called annihilation. Of an evolving entity, a seqence of evolutionary stages is inevitable. For instance, clay becomes a lump, jug, a potsherd, and (finally) powder. Here, what is called annihilation is the attainment of a succeeding stage by an entity which existed previously in a preceding stage. And this annihilation itself is called birth in that stage. Thus, the seence called birth and annihilation being inevitable for an evolving entity, it is not worthy of you to grieve. Now Sri Krsna says that not even the slightest grief arising from seeing an entity passing from a previous existing stage to an opposite stage, is justifiable in regard to human beings etc."

Accordingly has it been said: 'They emerged from invisibility, and have gone back to invisibility. They are not yours, nor are you theirs. What is this fruitless lamentation!' (Mbh. St. 2.13). Ka, what; paridevana, lamentation, or what prattle, can there be; tatra, with regard to them, i.e. with regard to beings which are objects of delusion, which are invisible, (become) visible, (and then) get destroyed!"

As they thus exist in their own natural stages, there is no cause for grief. After thus saying that there is no cause for grief even according to the view which identifies the body with the self, Sri Krsna proceeds to say that it is hard to find one who can be said to have truly perceived the Atman or spoken about It or heard about It or gained a true conception of It by hearing. For the Atman, which is actually different from the body, is of a wonderful nature."

In Agnisomiya etc., no injury is caused to the animal to be immolated; for, according to the Vedic Text, the victim, a he-goat, after abandoning an inferior body, will attain heaven etc., with a beautiful body. The Text pertaining to immolation declares: 'O animal, by this (immolation) you will never die, you are not destroyed. You will pass through happy paths to the realm of the gods, where the virtuous only reach and not the sinful. May the god Savitr give you a proper place.' (Yaj. 4.6.9.46).

This is the purport. Sri Krsna then explains to the aspirant for liberation how to conduct oneself in war."

The real context here (in 2.12 etc.), however, is of the realization of the supreme Reality. Now, in order to show the distinction between the (two) topics dealt with in this scripture, the Lord concludes that topic which has been presented above (in 2.20 etc.), by saying, 'This (wisdom) has been imparted,' etc. For, if the distinction between the topics of the scripute be shown here, then the instruction relating to the two kinds of adherences as stated later on in, 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3) will proceed again smoothly, and the hearer also will easily comprehend it by keeping in view the distinction between the topics.

      "English": "2.41 Here, i.e., in every ritual sanctioned by the scriptures, the Buddhi or disposition of mind marked by resolution, is single. The Buddhi marked by resolution is the Buddhi concerned with acts which must be performed by one desirous of release (and not any kind of work). The term 'Vyavasaya' menas unshakable conviction: this Buddhi (disposition of mind) comes out of prior determination about the true nature of the self. But the Buddhi concerning the performance of rituals of fulfill certain desires, is marked by irresolution; because here only this much knowledge of the self is sufficient - 'the self (as an entity) exists differently from the body.' Such a general understanding is sufficient to alify for performing acts giving fulfilment of certain desires. It does not reire any definite knowledge about the true nature of the self. For, even if there is no such knowledge, desires for heaven etc., can arise, the means for their attainment can be adopted, and the experience of those fruits can take place. For this reason there is no contradiction in the teaching of the scriptures. [The contradiction negated here is how can the same scriptural acts produce different results - fulfilment of desires and liberation. The difference in the disposition of the mind accouts of it.] The Buddhi (mental disposition) marked by resolution has a single aim, because it relates to the attainment of a single fruit. For, as far as one desiring release is concerned, all acts are enjoined only for the accomplishment of that single fruit. Therefore, since the purpose of the scriptures here is one only (i.e., liberation), the Buddhi regarding all rituals taught in the scriptures too is only one, as far as liberation-seekers are concerned. For example, the set of six sacrifices, beginning with Agneya with all their subsidiary processes (though enjoined in different passages) forms the subject of a single injunction, as they are all for the attainment of a single fruit. Conseently the Buddhi concerning these is one only. The meaning of the verse under discussion must be construed in the same manner. But the Buddhi of the irresolute ones who are engaged in rituals for winning such fruits as heaven, sons, cattle, food etc., are endless, frutis being endless. In rituals like Darsapurnamasa (new moon and full moon sacrifice), even though attainment of a single fruit (heaven) is enjoined, there accrues to these the character of having many branches on account of the mention of many secondary fruits as evidenced by such passages as, 'He desires a long life.' Therefore the Buddhi of irresolute ones has many branches and are endless. The purport is: In performing obligatory and occasional rituals, all fruits, primary and secondary, promised in the scriptures, should be abandoned, with the idea that release or salvation is the only purpose of all scripture-ordained rituals. These rituals should be performed without any thought of selfish gains. In addition, acts motivated by desires (Kamya-karmas) also should be performed according to one's own capacity, after abandoning all desire for fruits and with the conviction that they also, when performed in that way, form the means for attainment of release. They should be looked upon as eal to obligatory and occasional rites suited to one's own station and stage in life. Sri Krsna condemns those who perform acts for the attainment of objects of desire:"

It may be estioned why the Vedas, which have more of love for Jivas than thousands of parents, and which are endeavouring to save the Jivas, should prescribe in this way rites whose fruits are infinitesimal and which produce only new births. It can also be asked if it is proper to abandon what is given in the Vedas. Sri Krsna replies to these estions."

The Vedas in prescribing desire-oriented rituals (Kamya-karmas) have such persons in view. Because of their great love, the Vedas teach what is good to those in whom Tamas, Rajas and Sattva preponderate. If the Vedas had not explained to these persons the means for the attainment of heaven etc., according to the Gunas, then those persons who are not interested in liberation owing to absence of Sattva and preponderance of Rajas and Tamas in them, would get completely lost amidst what should not be resorted to, without knowing the means for attaining the results they desire. Hence the Vedas are concerned with the Gunas. Be you free from the three Gunas. Try to acire Sattva in abundance; increase that alone. The purport is: do not nurse the preponderance of the three Gunas in their state of inter-mixture; do not cultivate such preponderance. Be free from the pairs of opposites; be free from all the characteristics of worldly life. Abide in pure Sattva; be established in Sattva, in its state of purity without the admixture of the other two Gunas. If it is estioned how that is possible, the reply is as follows. Never care to acire things nor protect what has been acired. While abandoning the acisition of what is not reired for self-realisation, abandon also the conservation of such things already acired. You can thus be established in self-control and thery become an aspirant after the essentail nature of the self. 'Yoga' is acisition of what has not been acired; 'Ksema' is preservation of things already acired. Abandoning these is a must for an aspirant after the essential nature of the self. If you conduct yourself in this way, the preponderance of Rajas and Tamas will be annihilated, and pure Sattva will develop. Besides, all that is taught in the Vedas is not fit to be utilised by all."

Between the two kinds of actions, the one with eanimity and the other with attachment, the former associated with eanimity removes all the sufferings of Samsara and leads to release which is the highest object of human existence. The latter type of actions, which is pursued with an eye on results, leads one to Samsara whose character is endless suffering. Thus when an act is being done, take refuge in Buddhi (evenness of mind). Refuge means abode. Live in that Buddhi, is the meaning. 'Miserable are they who act with a motive for results': it means, 'Those who act with attachment to the results, etc., are miserable, as they will continue in Samsara.'"

In answer it is said that gross attachments are eliminated through discrimination which restrains the senses from being overpowered by objects. And the full Knowledge arising thereof eliminates the subtle inclinations as well. Hence there is no vicious circle involved.] Since the organs have to be first brought under his own control by one who desires to establish firmly the wisdom which is characterized by full realization, therefore the Lord speaks of the evil that arises from not keeping them under control:"

The unfitness of the mind to discriminate between what should or should not be done is called loss of understanding. Buddhi-nasat, from the loss of understanding; pranasyati, he perishes. Indeed, a man continues tobe himself so long as his mind remains fit to distinguish between what he ought to and ought not do. When it becomes unfit, a man is verily ruined. Therefore, when his internal organ, his understanding, is destroyed, a man is ruined, i.e. he becomes unfit for the human Goal. Thinking of objects has been said to be the root of all evils. After that, this which is the cause of Liberation is being now stated: [If even the memory of objects be a source of evil, then their enjoyment is more so. Hence, a sannyasin seeking Liberation cannot avoid this evil, since he has to move about for food which is necessary for the maintenance of his body. The present verse is an answer to this apprehension.]"

      "English": "2.69 ya, that which; sarva-bhutanam, for all creatures; is nisa, night which being darkness (tamah) by nature, obliterates distinctions among all things; what is that? that is the Reality which is the supreme Goal, accessible to the man of steady wisdom. As that which verily appears as day to the nocturnal creatures is night for others, similarly the Reality wich is the supreme Goal appears to be night, as it were, to all unenlightened beings who are comparable to the nocturnal creatures, because It is beyond the range of vision of those who are devoid of that wisdom. Samyami, the self-restrained man, whose organs are under control, i.e. the yogi [The man of realization.] who has arisen from the sleep of ignorance; jagarti, keeps awake; tasyam, in that (night) characterized as the Reality, the supreme Goal. That night of ignorance, characterized by the distinctions of subjects and objects, yasyam in which; bhutani, the creatures, who are really asleep; are said to be jagrati, keeping awake, in which night they are like dreamers in sleep; sa nisa, it is night; pasyatah, to the seeing; muneh, sage, who perceives the Reality that is the supreme Goal, because that (night) is ignorance by nature. Therefore, rites and duties are enjoined only during the state of ignorance, not in the state of enlightenment. For, when Knowledge dawns, ignorance becomes eradicated like the darkness of night after sun-rise. [It may be argued that even after illumination the phenomenal world, though it is known to be false, will continue to be perceived because of the persistence of past impressions; therefore there is scope for the validity of the scriptural injunctions even in the case of an illumined soul. The answer is that there will be no scope for the injunctions, because the man of realization will then have no ardent leaning towards this differentiated phenomenal world which makes an injunction relevant.] Before the rise of Knowledge, ignorance, accepted as a valid means of knowledge and presenting itself in the different forms of actions, means and results, becomes the cause of all rites and duties. It cannot reasonably become the source of rites and duties (after Realization) when it is understood as an invalid means of knowledge. For an agent becomes engaged in actions when he has the idea, 'Actions have been enjoined as a duty for me by the Vedas, which are a valid means of knowledge'; but not when he understands that 'all this is mere ignorance, like the night'. Again, the man to whom has come the Knowledge that all these differences in their totality are mere ignorance like the night, to that man who has realized the Self, there is eligibility only for renouncing all actions, not for engaging in actions. In accordance with this the Lord will show in the verse, 'Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose Self is That' (5.17) etc., that he has competence only for steadfastness in Knowledge. Objection: May it not be argued that, there will be no reason for being engaged even in that (steadfastness in Knowledge) if there be no valid means of knowledge [Vedic injunctions.] to impel one to that. [Because, without an injunction nobody would engage in a duty, much less in steadfastness to Knowledge.] Answer: No, since 'knowledge of the Self' relates to one's own Self. Indeed, by the very fact that It is the Self, and since the validity of all the means of knowledge culminates in It, [The validity of all the means of knowledge holds good only so long as the knowledge of the Self has not arisen.] therefore the Self does not depend on an injunction to impel It towards Itself. [Does the injunction relate to the knowledge of the Self. or to the Self Itself? The first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction. The second alternative also is untenable because the Self is self-revealing, whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved. And one's own Self is not an object of that kind.] Surely, after the realization of the true nature of the Self, there is no scope again for any means to, or end of, knowledge. The last valid means of (Self-) knowledge eradicates the possibility of the Self's becoming a perceiver. And even as it eradicates, it loses its own authoritativeness, in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state. In the world, too, after the preception of an abject, the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower (to any action with regard to that object). Hence, it is established that, for an knower of the Self, there remains no eligibility for rites and duties. The attainment of Liberation is only for the sannyasin [Liberation is attained only by one who, after aciring an intellectual knowledge of the Self in a general way, is endowed with discrimination and detachment, has arisen above all desires, has become a monk in the primary sense, and has directly realized the Self by going through the process of sravana (understanding of Upanisadic texts about the Self), etc.], the man of enlightenment, who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom; but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects (of the senses). Such being the case, with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration, the Lord says:"

Arjuna was under the delusion that the body is itself the self, and dominated by that delusion, had retreated from battle. He was therefore taught the knowledge called 'Sankhya' or the understanding of the self, and Yoga or what is called the path of practical work without attachment.

What may be the reason for this?', and also in, 'Tatkim, why then, O Kesava; niyojayasi, do You urge; mam, me; to ghore, horrible, cruel; karmani, action; involving injury?'-that (censure) also does not become reasonable.

Now then, which is that steadfastness of two kinds? In answer the Lord says: The steadfastness jnanayogena, through the Yoga of Knowledge-Knowledge itself being the Yoga [Here jnana, Knowledge, refers to the knowledge of the supreme Reality, and Yoga is used in the derivative sense of 'that (Knowledge) through which one gets united with Brahman'.]-; had been stated sankhyanam, for the men of realization-those possessed of the Knowledge arising from the discrimination with regard to the Self and the not-Self, those who have espoused monasticism from the stage of Celibacy; itself, those to whom the entity presented by the Vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained (see Mu. 3.2.6)-,the monks who are known as the parama-hamsas, those who are established in Brahman alone. And the steadfastness karma-yogena, through the Yoga of Action-action itself being the Yoga [Yoga here means 'that through which one gets united with, comes to have, prosperity', i.e. such actions as go by the name of righteousness and are prescribed by the scriptures.] had been stated yoginam, for the yogis, the men of action (rites and duties). This is the idea. Again, had it been intended or stated or if it will be stated in the Gita by the Lord-and if it has also been so stated in the Vedas-that Knowledge and action are to be practised in combination by one and the same person for attaining the same human Goal, why then should He here tell His dear supplicant Arjuna, that steadfastness in either Knowledge or action is to be practised only by different persons who are respectively alified? If, on the other hand, it be supposed that the Lord's idea is, 'After hearing about both Knowledge and action, Arjuna will himself practise them (in combination); but, to others, I shall speak of them as being meant to be pursued by different persons', then the Lord would be imagined to be unreliable, being possessed of likes and dislikes! And that is untenable. So, from no point of view whatsoever can there be a combination of Knowledge and action. And what has been said by Arjuna regarding superiority of Wisdom over action, that stands confirmed for not having been refuted; and (it also stands confirmed) that steadfastness in Knowledge is suitable for being practised by monks alone. And from the statement that they (Knowledge and action) are to be followed by different persons, it is understood that this has the Lord's approval. Noticing that Arjuna had become dejected under the impression, 'You are urging me to that very action which is a source of bondage', and was thinking thus, 'I shall not undertake action', the Lord said, 'Na karmanam anarambhat, not by abstaining from action,' etc. Or:-When steadfastness in Knowledge and steadfastness in action become incapable of being pursued simultaneously by one and the same person owing to mutual contradiction, then, since it may be concluded that they become the cause of attaining the human Goal independently of each other, therefore, in order to show-that the steadfastness in action is a means to the human Goal, not independently, but by virtue of being instrumental in securing steadfastness in Knowledge; and that, on the other hand, steadfastness in Knowledge, having come into being through the means of steadfastness in action, leads to the human Goal independently without anticipating anything else-,the Lord said:"

But he who performs the worship of the Supreme Person without desire for fruits and thery gets completely rid of inner impurities and keeps his senses unagitated - he becomes competent for the path of knowledge. That all activities are for performing the worship of the Supreme Person will be taught in the Gita verse, 'He from `whom the activities of all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded - by worshipping Him with his duty man reaches perfection' (18.46). Earlier also performance of activities without any attachment to the fruits is enjoined by the verse beginning with. 'You have the right to work alone ৷৷.' (2.47). Next for those whose intellect has been redeemed by this kind of discipline, is enjoined Jnana Yoga by the words, 'When a man renounces all the desires ৷৷.' (2.55). Conseently, firm devotion to Jnana Yoga is taught only to the Sankhyas, i.e., those persons who are competent to follow the discipline of the knowledge of the self, and Karma Yoga to Yogins, i.e., to those competent for the path of work. Sankhya means Buddhi and those who are endowed with the Buddhi (intellectual or mental disposition) having only the self for its object, are Sankhyans. Therefore those who are not fit for this are alified for Karma Yoga. Those who are possessed of Buddhi which is agitated by objects of the senses, are the persons alified for Karma Yoga, whereas those whose Buddhi is not thus agitated, are alified for Jnana Yoga. Therefore nothing contradictory and confusing is taught. It is said in the next stanza that Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise all at once, even when the desire for release arises in any worldy person:"

      "English": "3.4 Purusah, a person; na does not; asnute, attain; naiskarmyam, freedom from action, the state of being free from action, steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, i.e. the state of abiding in one's own Self which is free from action; anarambhat, by abstaining; karmanam, from actions-by the non-performance of actions such as sacrifices etc. which are or were performed in the present or past lives, which are the causes of the purification of the mind by way of attenuating the sins incurred, and which, by being the cause of that (purification), become the source of steadfastness in Knowledge through the generation of Knowledge, as stated in the Smrti (text), 'Knowledge arises in a person from the attenuation of sinful acts' [the whole verse is: Jnanam utpadyate pumsamksayatpapasya karmanah; Yathadarsatalaprakhye pasyatyatmanamatmani. 'Knowledge arises৷৷.acts. One sees the Self in oneself as does one (see oneself) in a cleaned surface of a mirror'.-Tr.] (Mbh. Sa. 204.8). This is the import. From the statement that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions, it may be concluded that one attains freedom from action by following the opposite course of performing actions. What, again, is the reason that one does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from actions? The answer is: Because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action. Indeed, there can be no attainment of an end without (its) means. And Karma-yoga is the means to the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action, because it has been so established in the Upanisads and here as well. As for the Upanisads, it has been shown in the texts, 'The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas, sacrifices, (charity, and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of sense-objects)' (Br. 4.4.22), etc. whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of Knowledge under discussion, viz the Realm of the Self, that the Yoga of Karma is a means to the Yoga of Knowledge . And even here (in the Gita), the Lord will established that, 'But, O mighty-armed one, renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma-)yoga' (5.6); 'By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work৷৷.for the purification of themselves' (5.11); 'Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise' (18.5), etc. Objection: Is it not that in such texts as-'Extending to all creatures immunity from fear' (Na. Par. 5.43), (one should take recourse to freedom from action)-, it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? And in the world, too, it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions. Hence also arises the estion, 'Why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?' Reply: Therefore the Lord said: Na ca, nor; samadhi-gacchati, does he attain; siddhim, fulfilment steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge, characterized by freedom from action; sannyasanat eva, merely through renunciation-even from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of Knowledge. What, again, is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with Knowledge, a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? To this ery seeking to know the cause, the Lord says:"

For Karma-yoga is meant only for the unenlightened, nor for the men of Knowledge. Karma-yoga, on the other hand, is not pertinent for the men of Knowledge who, because of their not moving away from their own Self, are not shaken by the gunas.

    "Ramanujacharya": {
      "Hindi": "Not Availble - Coming Soon",
      "English": "3.8 'Obligatory' (Niyatam) means 'concomitant' (Vyaptam); for action is concomitant with that which is conjoined with Prakrti or the body. The contact with Prakrti has arisen from beginingless subtle impressions (Vasanas). You must perform work, because the performance of action is easy and may not cause accidents by reason of its being obligatory. Action is superior to non-action, i.e., even to the devotee of Jnana. Because of the instruction at the beginning (of this context), 'No man experiences freedom from activity' (3.4), devotion to Jnana alone is indicated by the word, 'Non-action' (Akarma). Even in the case of one alified for devotion to Jnana, devotion to Karma indeed is better because Jnana-nistha is difficult to perform and liable to accidents, as it has not been practised previoulsy and as it does not come to one naturally. Subseently it will be described how, one with the knowledge of the true nature of the self can carry on actions along with that knowledge. Conseently, we should take the meaning here to be that, because knowledge of the self too is included in Karma Yoga, this kind of Yoga is superior. This statement on the superiority of activity (Karma Yoga) over Jnana Yoga is valid even when there is competency for one to adopt Jnana Yoga. For, if you abandon all activities to alify yourself for Jnana Yoga, then, for you, who is thus inactive while following Jnana Yoga, even the nourishment of the body, which is necessary even for Jnana-nistha, will not be achieved. The body has to be necessarily sustained until the means are executed to the full. Performing 'great sacrifices' with the help of honestly earned wealth, the body should be sustained by consuming the remainders left after such sacrifices. This is made clear from scriptural texts like, 'When the food is pure, the Sattva (mind or inner organ) becomes pure; when the Sattva is pure, then the remembrance (meditation) will be steady' (Cha. U., 7.26.2). Sri Krsna himself will declare: 'The sinful ones who cook food for their own sake eat sin (3.13). Conseently,even the sustenance of the body will not be possible in the case of one who practises Jnana-nistha, and does not act. In other ways also Karma Yoga is superior to Jnana Yoga even in respect of one who is alified for Jnana-nistha; for, obligatory and occasional rites like the 'great sacrifices' must be carried out by one who follows Jnana Yoga too, as he has to sustain the body until he attains perfection. Besides, the understanding of the true nature of the self is incorporated in Karma Yoga, as it involves the contemplation of the self as being a non-agent. It is also in line with the nature of life (Prakrti). Karma Yoga, is for these reasons easier and it is free from danger of downfall. Therefore, you must perform Karma Yoga only. This is the purport of the verse. If it is contended that any action such as earning money implies 'I-ness', 'My-ness' etc., and will therefore be disturbing to the senses, and that such a person devoted often to works will be in bondage through subtle impressions of his acts, Sri Krsna says:"

Na., 11.3), it is justifiable to take the term Prajapati in its wider connotation and interpret it to mean Narayana who is the Lord of all beings, the creator of the universe and the Self of the universe. In the beginning, i.e., during the creation, He, the Lord of beings, saw all beings helpless by their conjunction with beginningless non-conscient matter, bereft of the distinctions of name and form, and submerged in Himself. They were incapable of attaining the major ends of human existence, being almost one with non-conscient matter. He, the supremely compassionate, with a desire to resuscitate them, created them together with sacrifice in order that they might perform sacrifices as His worship and said: 'By this sacrifice, shall you prosper,' i.e., multiply and prosper. May this sacrifice fulfil your supreme object of desire called release (Moksa) and also the other desires that are in conformity with it. How, then, should this be done?"

The 'Brahman' arises from the imperishable self. Here the term, 'imperishable', indicates the individual self. The physical body, which is inhabited by the self who is satisfied by food and drink, is fit for action; hence the physical body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the imperishable.

Therefore, the gist of the topic under discussion is that action must be undertaken by one who is alified (for action) but is unenlightened. In the verses beginning from, '(A person does not attain freedom from action by adstaining from action' (4) and ending with, 'You perform the obligatory duties৷৷.And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible' (8), it has been proved that before one attains fitness for steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self, it is the bounden duty of a person who is alified for action, but is not enlightened, to undertake Karma-yoga for that purpose. And then, also in the verses commencing from '(This man becomes bound) by actions other than that action meant for God' (9) and ending with 'O Partha, he lives in vain,' many reasons [Such as, that it pleases God, secures the affection of the gods, and so on.] have been incidentally stated as to why a competent person has to undertake actions; and the evils arising from their non-performance have also been emphatically declared. Such being the conclusion, the estion arises whether the wheel thus set in motion should be followed by all, or only by one who is ignorant of the Self and has not attained to the steadfastness which is fit to be practised by the Sankhyas, the knowers of the Self, through the Yoga of Knowledge only, and which is acired by one ignorant of the Self through the means of the practice of Karma-yoga mentioned above? Either anticipating Arjuna's estion to this effect, or in order to make the meaning of the scripture (Gita) clearly understood, the Lord, revealing out of His own accord that the following substance of the Upanisads-Becoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very Self, the Brahmanas renounce what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge, viz, desire for sons, etc., and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body; they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self (cf. Br. 3.5.1)-has been presented here in the Gita, says:"

In this manner there is a seence which revolves like a wheel through the mutual relations of cause and effect. Hence, He who is engaged in spiritual practice - whether one is alified for Karma Yoga or Jnana Yoga - if he does not follow, i.e., does not keep in motion the wheel which revolves in a circle through mutual relation of cause and effect - that person by not maintaining his bodily subsistence by means of the 'remainder of sacrifice,' lives in sin. His life begins in sin or develops in sin, or is of both these kinds; he lives the life of sin. Thus he is a reveller in his senses and not in his self. The senses become the pleasure-gardens of one whose mind and body are not nourished by the 'remainders of sacrifices.' Rajas and Tamas preponderate in his body. Being thus turned away from the vision of the self, he rejoices only in the enjoyment of the senses. Therefore, even if he were to attempt for the vision of the self, it will be fruitless. So he lives in vain, O Arjuna. Sri Krsna now says that there is no need for the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc., according to his station and stage of life, only in respect of a liberated person whose vision of the self does not depend on any external means."

Because of their incomplete knowledge of the self, they are not alified for Jnana Yoga which is of the nature of practising knowledge of the self. They are alified for Karma Yoga only. As they should practise Karma Yoga for the vision of the self in the same manner Karma Yoga should be practised by one who is recognised as virtuous, who is unattached to work by reason of the vision of the self, and who wishes that his conduct should give guidance to others in virtuous conduct. In this way he should protect the world from chaos by his example. Such a person, even though alified for Jnana Yoga, should practice Karma Yoga."

They are therefore attached to the actions of the Gunas - i.e., only to actions forming part of Karma Yoga. They are alified only for Karma Yoga. One who knows the complete truth should not, by himself remaining a practitioner of Jnana Yoga, unsettle those persons who are ignorant and who do not know the complete truth. Those, the ignorant, who tend to follow the behaviour of a great man, when they see him transcend Karma Yoga, will have their minds shaken from Karma Yoga. Thus, the great man, should himself remain established in Karma Yoga, while having the full knowledge of the true nature of the self and contemplating on the self as not being the agent. Thus he should demonstrate that Karma Yoga by itself is an autonomous means for the vision of the self. He should create in those who do not know the complete truth the love of Karma Yoga. The superiority of this Karma Yoga over Jnana Yoga even for those who are alified for Jnana Yoga has already been stated. Therefore one who is a respected person of note should follow this Karma Yoga alone for the good of the world. The method of performing actions after attributing agency to the Gunas by discerning the nature of the self as different from Prakrti, has been taught. The agency of the self is not produced by the inherent nature of the self, but by its contact with the Gunas. Hence by discriminating between what is obtained by contact and not obtained when there is no contact, it has to be understood that this agency is due to the Gunas or Prakrti. Now it is said that the agency of works, first attributed to Gunas, ultimately go to the Supreme Person who is the Self of all. It is done by discerning that the nature of the individual self is one of subservience to the Supreme Person, as they constitute His body:"

Surrender all acts to Me, the Lord of all, who constitutes the inner pervading Self of all beings. 'Adhyatma-cetas' is that mind which is focussed on the self by knowledge of the essential nature of the self as declared in hundreds of Vedic texts. That this individual self constitutes the body of the Supreme Self and is actuated by Him, is taught by Sruti texts like: 'He who has entered within, is the ruler of all beings and is the Self of all' (Tai. Ar., 3.11), 'Him who has entered inside and is the doer' (Ibid., 3.23), 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the Self does not know, whose body is the self, who controls the self from within - He is your internal ruler and Immortal Self' (Br. U., 3.7.22). Smrti texts also speak in the same manner: 'Him who is the ruler of all' (Manu, 12.122). Sri Krsna will say later on: 'And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge and the faculty of reason' (15.15); 'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of everything causing them to spin round and round by His power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). Hence, dedicate to Me, the Supreme Person, all actions considering them as done by Me, by contemplating on the self as actuated by Me by reason of Its constituting My body. And do every thing, considering the actions as My worship only; becoming free from desire for fruits and therefore free from selfishness as regards actions, engage in acts like war etc., devoid of 'fever', i.e., the excitement caused by passions like anger. Contemplate that the Supreme Person, Lord of all, Principal of all, gets done His own works only for the purpose of getting Himself worshipped with His own instruments, namely, the individual selves which belong to Him and are His agents. Become free from selfish attachment to action. Also be free from the feverish concern originating from such thoughts as 'What will become of me with an ancient, endless accumulation of evil arising from beginningless time?' Perform Karma Yoga with ease, for the Supreme Person Himself, worshipped by acts, will free you from bondage. His Lordship and Principalship over all are settled by Sruti texts like: 'Him who is the supreme and great Lord of lords, Him the Supreme Divinity of divinities' (Sve. U., 6.7), 'The Lord of the Universe' (Tai. Na., 11.3), 'The Supreme Ruler of rulers' (Sve. U., 6.6-7). Isvaratva is the same as Sesitva, which means controllership. Sri Krsna declares that this alone is the essential meaning of the Upanisads:"

Contemplating thus, Karma Yoga alone should be practised by both - those who are competent for Karma Yoga only and those who are competent for Jnana Yoga. The implied superiority of Karma Yoga has the following justifications; it is easy to perform, free from liability to lapse, and independent of anything else; it comprises the knowledge of the self also within its scope. On the other hand Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise, is not free from the liability to lapse, leaves one dependent on actions for the sustenance of the body etc. And for a distinguished perosn, this (i.e., Karma Yoga) is especially what ought to be practised.

Thus, these two, attachment and aversion, bring under their control one who aspires to follow Jnana Yoga, and forcibly engage him in actions appropriate to them, in spite of his having established some sort of control over the senses. Such an aspirant fails to get the experience of the self, and therefore becomes completely lost. So no one practising Jnana Yoga should come under the sway of attachment and aversion, which are ruinous. These two, attachment and aversion, are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the practice of Jnana Yoga."

And the birth of Vivasvan was at an earlier time, reckoned as twenty-eight cycles of units of four Yugas each. How can I understand as true that you taught it in the beginning? Now, there is no contradiction here, for it was ite possible that He had taught Vivasvan in a former birth. The memory of what was done in former births is ite natural for great men. This should not be taken to mean that Arjuna does not know the son of Vasudeva, the speaker, as the Lord of all. Because he (Arjuna) says later on: 'You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal Divine Purusa, the Primal Lord, unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also are saying this to me' (10.12-13.) Arjuna had heard repeatedly from Bhisma and others during the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira, 'Krsna alone is the cause of creation and submergence of all the worlds. This universe, consisting of things both animate and inanimate, was created for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha., 2.38.23) 'The entire universe is subservient to Krsna' is the meaning of 'For the sake of Krnsa'. This apparent contradiction may be explained as follows: Arjuna surely knows the son of Vasudeva as the Bhagavan. Though knowing Him as such, he estions as if he did not know Him. This is his intention. Can the birth of the Lord of all, who is antagonistic to all that is evil and wholly auspicious, omniscient, whose will is always true and whose desires are fulfilled - can the birth of such a Person be of the same nature as that of the gods, men etc., who are subject to Karma? Or can it be false like the illusions of a magical show? Or could it be real? In other words, is the birth of the Supreme Being as the incarnate a real fact or a mere illusory phenomenon produced by a magician's art? If His birth is real, what is the mode of His birth? What is the nature of His body? What is the manner of His birth? What is the nature of this body of His? What is the casue of His birth? To what end is He born? The way in which Sri Krsna answers Arjuna's estion, justifies the construing of his estion in this way."

      "English": "4.6 Without forsaking any of the My special alities, as supreme rulership, birthless, imperishability etc., I am born by My free will. Prakrti means one's own nature. The meaning is that by employment of My own Nature and taking a form of My choice, I incarnate by My own will (Maya). The character of My own Nature becomes evident from the following Srutis: 'Him who is of sun-like colour, beyond darkness (Tamas)' (Sve. U., 3.8), 'Him who abides beyond Rajas (active matter)' (Sama 17.1.4.2); 'This Golden Person who is within the sun' (Cha. U. 1.6.6); 'Within the heart, there is the Person consisting of mind, immortal and golden' (Tai. U. 1.6.1); 'All mortal creatures have come from the self-luminous Person' (Yaj., 32.2); 'Whose form is light, whose will is truth, who is the self of ethereal space, who contains all actions, contains all desires, contains all odours, contains all tastes' (Cha. U., 3.14.2); 'Like a raiment of golden colour' (Br. U., 4.3.6). 'Atma-mayaya' means through the Maya which belongs to Myself. Here the term Maya is identical with knowledge as stated in the lexicon of Yaska: 'Maya is wisdom, knowledge.' Further there is the usage of competent people: 'By Maya, He knows the good and bad of his creatures.' Hence by My own knowledge means 'by My will.' Hence, without abandoning My essential attributes which belong to Me the Lord of all, such as being free of sins, having auspicious attributes etc., and creating My own form similar to the configuration of gods, men etc., I incarnate in the form of gods etc. The Sruti teaches the same thing: 'Being unborn, He is born in various forms' (Tai. A., 3.12.7). The purport is that His birth is ite unlike that of ordinary beings. The dissimilarity consists in that He is born out of His own will unlike ordinary beings whose birth is necessitated by their Karma. Thus constured, there is no contradiction also between what was taught earlier and what is taught later as in the statements: 'Many births of Mine have passed, O Arjuna, and similarly yours also. I know them all' (4.5); 'I incarnate Myself' (4.7); and 'He who thus knows in truth My birth and work' (4.9). [All this elaboration is meant to refute the doctrine of mere apparency of incarnations as taught by the Advaitins. Ramanuja, as stated in his Introduction to the Bhasya, upholds the absolute reality of incarnations.] Sri Krsna now specifies the times of His incarnations."

As to that, the control of the mind and body, austerity, etc. are the duties of the Brahmanas, who are sattvika, i.e. have a predominance of the ality of sattva (purity, goodness, etc.). Courage, valour, etc. are the duties of the Ksatriyas, in whom sattva becomes secondary and rajas (passion, attachment, etc.) preponderates. Agriculture etc. are the duties of the Vaisya, in whom tamas (indolence, ignorance, etc.) is secondary and rajas is predominant. Service is the only duty of the Sudra, in whom rajas is secondary and tamas predominates (see chapters 14, 16,17 and 18). In this way, the four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. This is the idea. And these four castes do not prevail in the other worlds. Hence the specification, 'in the human world'. 'Well, in that caste, by virtues of Your being he agent of the acts of creation of the four castes,etc. You become subject tothe conseence of those actions? Therefore you are not eternally free and the eternal Lord!' This is being answered: Api, even though; I am kartaram, the agent; tasya, of that act, from the empirical standpoint of maya; still, from the highest standpoint, viddhi, know; mam, Me; to be akartaram, a non-agent; and therefore, also know Me to be avyayam, changeless, not subject to the cycle of births and deaths. 'In reality, however, I am not the agent of those actions of which you think I am the agent.' Because"

      "English": "4.14 These actions of varied nature like creation etc., do not contaminate Me i.e., do not bind Me. For the distinctions of gods, men etc., are not brought about by Me, but by the particular Karmas, good and evil, of created beings. Therefore by the process of discriminating between the acired and the inherent, it will be found that I am not the author of this varied creations etc. The created or embodied selves, who are endowed with bodies and organs at the time of creation in accordance with their own Karmas springing from attachment to fruits etc., experience all enjoyments available in creation. Thus for them (embodied selves) alone there is desire for the results of creation etc., and for the results of their Karmas. There is no desire in Me for it. The Sutrakara says to the same effect: 'No partiality or cruelty on account of there being dependence (on the Karma of souls for inealities' (Br. S., 2.1.34). Bhagavan Parasara also says so: 'He (the Lord) is only the operative cause in the creation of beings. That from which the creative forces spring constitutes the material cause. Leaving aside the material cause, the being that becomes embodied does not reire the help of any other thing whatever. A thing is led into the condition in which it is, O best of ascetics, only by its own potentiality' (V. P., 1.4.51-2). The Supreme Person is only the operative cause with regard to the creation of those to be created, i.e., the selves in the bodies of gods etc. The material cause for the differences into gods etc., is the potentiality in the form of previous Karmas of the selves to be created. Therefore, leaving aside the operative cause, i.e., the Supreme Person, the creator, the embodied beings do not reire anything else for causing difference into conditions of gods etc. For these selves are led to take the forms of gods etc., by the potentiality of their own old Karma with which they are connected. Such is the meaning. He who knows Me thus to be the agent of creation etc., and still a non-agent, i.e., as one who has no desire for the results of the acts of creation etc., - such a person is not tied by previous actions, i.e., he is freed from the old Karmas which obstruct the undertaking of Karma Yoga by causing attachment to results. Such is the purport."

देखता है अर्थात् कर्मका अभाव देखता है तथा अकर्ममें शरीरादिकी चेष्टाके अभावमें जो कर्म देखता है। अर्थात् कर्मका करना और न करना दोनों ही कर्ताके अधीन हैं। तथा आत्मतत्त्वकी प्राप्तिसे पूर्व अज्ञानावस्थामें ही सब क्रियाकारक आदि व्यवहार है ( इसीलिये कर्मका त्याग भी कर्म ही है ) इस प्रकार जो अकर्ममें कर्म देखता है। वह मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् है वह योगी है और वह समस्त कर्मोंको करनेवाला है इस प्रकार कर्ममें अकर्म और अकर्ममें कर्म देखनेवालेकी स्तुति की जाती है। पू0 जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखता है और अकर्ममें कर्म देखता है यह विरुद्ध बात किस भावसे कही जा रही है क्योंकि कर्म तो अकर्म नहीं हो सकता और अकर्म कर्म नहीं हो सकता तब देखनेवाला विरुद्ध कैसे देखे उ0 वास्तवमें जो अकर्म है वही मूढमति लोगोंको कर्मके सदृश भास रहा है और उसी तरह कर्म अकर्मके सदृश भास रहा है उसमें यथार्थ तत्त्व देखनेके लिये भगवान्ने कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वाक्य कहे हैं इसलिये ( उनका कहना ) विरुद्ध नहीं है क्योंकि बुद्धिमान् आदि विशेषण भी तभी सम्भव हो सकते हैं। इसके सिवा यथार्थ ज्ञानको ही जाननेयोग्य कहा जा सकता है ( मिथ्या ज्ञानको नहीं )। तथा जिसको जानकर अशुभसे मुक्त हो जायगा। यह भी कहा है सो विपरीत ज्ञानद्वारा ( जन्ममरणरूप ) अशुभसे मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती। सुतरां प्राणियोंने जो कर्म और अकर्मको विपरीतरूपसे समझ रक्खा है उस विपरीत ज्ञानको हटानेके लिये ही भगवान्के कर्मण्यकर्म यः इत्यादि वचन हैं। यहाँ कुण्डेमें बेरोंकी तरह कर्मका आधार अकर्म नहीं है और उसी तरह अकर्मका आधार कर्म भी नहीं है क्योंकि कर्मके अभावका नाम अकर्म है। इसलिये ( यही सिद्ध हुआ कि ) मृगतृष्णामें जलकी भाँति एवं सीपमें चाँदीकी तरह लोगोंने कर्म और अकर्मको विपरीत मान रक्खा है। पू0 कर्मको सब कर्म ही मानते हैं इसमें कभी फेरफार नहीं होता। उ0 यह बात नहीं क्योंकि नाव चलते समय नौकामें बैठे हुए पुरुषको तटके अचल वृक्षोंमें प्रतिकूल गतिदीखती है अर्थात् वे वृक्ष उलटे चलते हुए दीखते हैं और जो ( नक्षत्रादि ) पदार्थ नेत्रोंके पास नहीं होते बहुत दूर होते हैं उन चलते हुए पदार्थोंमें भी गतिका अभाव दीख पड़ता है अर्थात् वे अचल दीखते हैं। इसी तरह यहाँ भी अकर्ममें ( क्रियारहित आत्मामें ) मैं करता हूँ यह कर्मका देखना और ( त्यागरूप ) कर्ममें ( मैं कुछ नहीं करता इस ) अकर्मका देखना ऐसे विपरीत देखना होता है अतः उसका निराकरण करनेके लिये कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वचन भगवान् कहते हैं। यद्यपि यह विषय अनेक बार शंकासमाधानोंद्वारा सिद्ध किया जा चुका है तो भी अत्यन्त विपरीत ज्ञानकी भावनासे अत्यन्त मोहित हुए लोग अनेक बार सुने हुए तत्त्वको भी भूलकर मिथ्या प्रसंग लालाकर शंका करने लग जाते हैं इसलिये तथा आत्मतत्त्वको दुर्विज्ञेय समझकर भगवान् पुनःपुनः उत्तर देते हैं। श्रुति स्मृति और न्यायसिद्ध जो आत्मामें कर्मोंका अभाव है वह अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयम् न जायते म्रियते इत्यादि श्लोकोंसे कहा जा चुका और आगे भी कहा जायगा। उस क्रियारहित आत्मामें अर्थात् अकर्ममें कर्मका देखनारूप जो विपरीत दर्शन है यह लोगोंमें अत्यन्त स्वाभाविकसा हो गया है। क्योंकि कर्म क्या है और अकर्म क्या है इस विषयमें बुद्धिमान् भी मोहित हैं। अर्थात् देहइन्द्रियादिसे होनेवाले कर्मोंका आत्मामें अध्यारोप करके मैं कर्ता हूँ मेरा यह कर्म है मुझे इसका फल भोगना है इस प्रकार ( लोग मानते हैं। ) तथा मैं चुप होकर बैठता हूँ जिससे कि परिश्रमरहित और कर्मरहित होकर सुखी हो जाऊँ इस प्रकार देहइन्द्रियोंके व्यापारकी उपरामताका और उससे होनेवाले सुखीपनका आत्मामें अध्यारोप करके मैं कुछ भी नहीं करता हूँ चुपचाप सुखसे बैठा हूँ इस प्रकार लोग मानते हैं। लोगोंके इस विपरीत ज्ञानको हटानेके लिये कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि वचन भगवान्ने कहे हैं। यहाँ देहेन्द्रियादिके आश्रयसे होनेवाला कर्म यद्यपि क्रियारूप है तो भी उसका लोगोंने कर्मरहित अविक्रिय आत्मामें अध्यारोप कर रक्खा है क्योंकि शास्त्रज्ञ विद्वान् भी मैं करता हूँ ऐसा मान बैठता है। अतः नदीतीरस्थ वृक्षोंमें भ्रमसे प्रतिकूल गति प्रतीत होनेकी भाँति अज्ञानसे आत्माके नित्य सम्बन्धी माने जाकर जो लोकमें कर्म नामसे प्रसिद्ध हो रहे हैं उन कर्मोंमें वस्तुतः नदीतीरस्थ वृक्षोंमें गतिका अभाव देखनेकी भाँति जो अकर्म देखता है अर्थात् कर्माभाव देखता है तथा कर्मकी भाँति आत्मामें अज्ञानसे आरोपित किये हुए शरीर इन्द्रिय आदिकी उपरामतारूप अकर्ममें अर्थात् क्रियाके त्यागमें भी मैं कुछ न करता हुआ चुपचाप सुखपूर्वक बैठा हूँ इस अहंकारका सम्बन्ध होनेके कारण जो कर्म देखता है यानी उस त्यागको भी जो कर्म समझता है। इस प्रकार जो कर्म और अकर्मके विभागको ( तत्त्वसे ) जाननेवाला है वह मनुष्योंमें बुद्धिमान् पण्डित है वह युक्त योगी है और सम्पूर्ण कर्म करनेवाला भी वही है अर्थात् वह पुण्यपापरूप अशुभसे मुक्त हुआ कृतकृत्य है। कई टीकाकार इस श्लोककी दूसरी तरहसे ही व्याख्या करते हैं। कैसे ईश्वरके लिये किये जानेवाले जो ( पञ्च महायज्ञादि ) नित्यकर्म हैं उनका फल नहीं मिलता इस कारण वे गौणी वृत्तिसे अकर्म कहे जाते हैं ( इसी प्रकार ) उन नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेका नाम अकर्म है वह भी पापरूप फलके देनेवाला होनेके कारण गौणरूपसे ही कर्म कहा जाता है। जैसे कोई गौ ब्यायी हुई होनेपर भी यदि दूधरूप फल नहीं देती तो वह अगौ कह दी जाती है वैसे ही नित्यकर्ममें उसके फलका अभाव होनेके कारण जो अकर्म देखता है और नित्यकर्मका न करनारूप जो अकर्म है उसमें कर्म देखता है क्योंकि वह नरकादि विपरीत फल देनेवाला है। यह व्याख्या ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि इस प्रकार जाननेसे अशुभसे मुक्ति नहीं हो सकती अर्थात् जन्ममरणबन्धन नहीं टूट सकता। अतः यह अर्थ मान लेनेसे भगवान्के कहे हुए ये वचन कि जिसको जानकर तू अशुभसे मुक्त हो जायगा। कट जायँगे। क्योंकि नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे तो शायद अशुभसे छुटकारा हो भी जाय परंतु उन नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं होता इस ज्ञानसे तो मोक्ष हो ही नहीं सकता। क्योंकि नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं होता यह ज्ञान या नित्यकर्मोंका ज्ञान अशुभसे मुक्त कर देनेवाला है ऐसा शास्त्रोंमें कहीं नहीं कहा और न भगवान्ने ही गीताशास्त्रमें कहीं ऐसा कहा है। इसी युक्तिसे ( उनके बतलाये हुए ) अकर्ममें कर्मदर्शनका भी खण्डन हो जाता है। क्योंकि यहाँ ( गीतामें ) नित्यकर्मोंके अभावरूप अकर्ममें कर्म देखनेको कहीं कर्तव्यरूपसे विधान नहीं किया केवल नित्यकर्मकी कर्तव्यताका विधान है। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्म न करनेसे पाप होता है ऐसा जान लेनेसे ही कोई फल नहीं हो सकता। और यह नित्यकर्मका न करनारूप अकर्म शास्त्रोंमें कोई जाननेयोग्य विषय भी नहीं बताया गया है। तथा इस प्रकार दूसरे टीकाकारोंके माने हुए कर्ममें अकर्म और अकर्ममें कर्मदर्शन रूप इस मिथ्यादर्शनसे अशुभसे मुक्ति बुद्धिमत्ता युक्तता सर्वकर्मकर्तृत्व इत्यादि फल भी सम्भव नहीं और ऐसे मिथ्याज्ञानकी स्तुति भी नहीं बन सकती। जब कि मिथ्याज्ञान स्वयं ही अशुभरूप है तब वह दूसरे अशुभसे किसीको कैसे मुक्त कर सकेगा क्योंकि अन्धकार ( कभी ) अन्धकारका नाशक नहीं हो सकता। पू0 यहाँ जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखना और अकर्ममें कर्म देखना ( उन टीकाकारोंने ) बतलाया है वह मिथ्याज्ञान नहीं है किंतु फलके होने और न होनेके निमित्तसे गौणरूपसे देखना है। उ0 यह कहना भी ठीक नहीं क्योंकि गौणरूपसे कर्मको अकर्म और अकर्मको कर्म जान लेनेसे भी कोई लाभ नहीं सुना गया। इसके सिवा श्रुतिसिद्ध बातको छोड़कर श्रुतिविरुद्ध बातकी कल्पना करनेमें कोई विशेषता भी नहीं दिखलायी देती। ( भगवान्को यदि यही अभीष्ट होता तो वे ) उसी प्रकारके शब्दोंसे भी स्पष्ट कह सकते थे कि नित्यकर्मोंका कोई फल नहीं है और उनके न करनेसे नरकप्राप्ति होती है। फिर इस प्रकार कर्ममें जो अकर्म देखता है इत्यादि दूसरोंको मोहित करनेवाले मायायुक्त वचन कहनेसे क्या प्रयोजन था। इस प्रकार उपर्युक्त अर्थ करनेवालोंका तो स्पष्ट ही यह मानना हुआ कि भगवान्द्वारा कहे हुए वचन संसारको मोहित करनेके लिये हैं। इसके सिवा न तो यह कहना ही उचित है कि यह नित्यकर्मअनुष्ठानरूप विषय मायायुक्त वचनोंसे गुप्त रखनेयोग्य है और न यही कहना ठीक है कि ( यह विषय बड़ा गहन है इसलिये ) बारंबार दूसरेदूसरे शब्दोंद्वारा कहनेसे सुबोध होगा। क्योंकि कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते इस श्लोकमें स्पष्ट कहे हुए अर्थको फिर कहनेकी आवश्यकता नहीं होती। तथा सभी जगह जो बात करनेयोग्य होती है वही प्रशसंनीय और जाननेयोग्य बतलायी जाती है। निरर्थक बातको जाननेयोग्य है ऐसा नहीं कहा जाता। मिथ्याज्ञान या उसके द्वारा स्थापित की हुई आभासमात्र वस्तु जाननेयोग्य नहीं हो सकती। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेरूप अभावसे प्रत्यवायरूप भावकी उत्पत्ति भी नहीं हो सकती। क्योंकि नासतो विद्यते भावः इत्यादि भगवान्के वाक्य हैं तथा असत्से सत् कैसे उत्पन्न हो सकता है इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्य भी पहले दिखलाये जा चुके हैं। इस प्रकार असत्से सत्की उत्पत्तिका निषेध कर दिया जानेपर भी जो असत्से सत्की उत्पत्ति बतलाते हैं उनका तो यह कहना हुआ कि असत् तो सत् होता है और सत् असत् होता है परंतु यह सब प्रमाणोंसे विरुद्ध होनेके कारण अयुक्त है। तथा शास्त्र भी निरर्थक कर्मोंका विधान नहीं कर सकता क्योंकि सभी कर्म ( परिश्रमकी दृष्टिसे ) दुःख रूप हैं और जानबूझकर ( बिना प्रयोजन ) किसीका भी दुःखमें प्रवृत्त होना सम्भव नहीं। तथा उन नित्यकर्मोंको न करनेसे नरकप्राप्ति होती है ऐसा शास्त्रका आशय मान लेनेपर तो यह मानना हुआ कि कर्म करने और न करनेमें दोनों प्रकारसे शास्त्र अनर्थका ही कारण है अतः व्यर्थ है। इसके सिवा नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं है ऐसा मानकर फिर उनको मोक्षरूप फलके देनेवाला कहनेसे उन व्याख्याकारोंके मतमें स्वचोविरोध भी होता है। सुतरां कर्मणि अकर्म यः पश्येत् इत्यादि श्लोकका अर्थ जैसा ( गुरुपरम्परासे ) सुना गया है वही ठीक है और हमने भी उसीके अनुसार इस श्लोककी व्याख्या की है।",
      "English": "4.18 Since engagement and non-engagement (in action) depend on an agent, therefore, yah, he who; pasyet, ie. pasyati, finds; akarma, inaction, absence of action; karmani, in action-karma means whatever is done, action in general; in tha action-; and yah, who; finds karma, action; akarmani, in inaction, in the absence of action; sah, he; is buddhiman, a wise one; manusyesu, among men. All dealings involving an act, accessories, etc. exist certainly on the plane of ignorance, [Both engagement and non-engagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind. This, however, holds good on the plane of ignorance, but not on that of Self-realization.] only so long as one has not attained to the Reality. He is a yogi, yuktah, engaged in yoga; and a krtsna-karma-krt, performer of all actions. One who discriminates between action and actions. One who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus. Objection: Well, what is meant by this contradictory statement, 'He who finds inaction in action', and 'action in inaction'? For action cannot become inaction, nor inaction action. That being so, how can a witness have (such) an incongruous perception? Vedantin: Is it not that [Ast. reads na in place of nanu.-Tr.] to an ordinary foolsih observer, that which is reality is inaction appears as action, and similarly, action itself as inaction? That being so, in order to show things as they are the Lord says, 'He who finds inaction in action', etc. Therefore there is no incongruity. Besides, the alifications such as 'intelligent' etc. (thus) become logical. And by saying, 'there is something to be known', is implied the perception of things as they are. Moreover, freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it has been said, 'by knowing which you will become free from evil'. Therefore, one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures, the Lord's utterance, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. is for dispelling their contrary perception. Not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle, like a plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its receptacle, because inaction is a negation of action. Therefore, action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary persons-like seeing water in a mirage, or silver in nacre. Objection: Is it not that to every one action is action itself? Never is there an exception to this. Vedantin: That is not so, becuase when a boat is moving, motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one's eyes. Similarly, here also occurs the contrary perceptions, viz seeing action in inaction under the idea, 'I am doing', [Ast. omits 'aham karomi iti, under the idea, \"I am doing\"'.-Tr.] and seeing, inaction in acion,-because of which it is said, 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. in order to eliminate them. As such, although this answer has been given more than once, still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception. And forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again, he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! And therefore, observing that the subject is difficult to understand, the Lord gives His answer again and again. The absence of action in the Self-well-known from the Vedas, Smrtis and logic, as stated in, '(It is said that) This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable' (2.25), 'Never is this One born, and never does It die' (2.20; Ka. 1.2.18), etc.-has been and will be spoken of. The contrary perception of action in that actionless Self, i.e. in inaction, is very deep-rooted, owing to which 'even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction.' And as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc. on the Self, there arises such ideas as, 'I am an agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed by me.' Similarly, with the idea, 'I shall remain iet, whery I shall be free from exertion, free from activity, and happy', and superimposing on the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness, a man imagines, 'I shall not do anything; I shall sit ietly and happily.' That being so, the Lord says, 'he who finds inaction in action,' etc. with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man. And here in this world, though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action, still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless, unchanging Self, as a result of which even a learned person things, 'I act.' Therefore, in action (karmani), which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the Self, like the perception of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a river-(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction, like perceiving absence of motion in those trees-. And, in inaction (akarmani) in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same way that actions are ascribed-, in that action, he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea, 'I am happily seated ietly, without doing anything'-; he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction, is wise, is learned among men; he is engaged in yoga, he is a yogi, and a performer of all actions. And he, freed from evil, attains fulfilment. This is the meaning. This verse is interpreted by some in another way. How? (Thus:) 'Since the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to God, therefore, in a secondary sense, they are said to be inaction. Again, the non-performance of these (nitya-karmas) is inaction; since this produces an evil result, therefore it is called action, verily in a figurative sense. That being so, he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nitya-karmas) owing to the obsence of their results-in the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow, though in reality it is so-so also, in the non-performance of the daily obligatory duties, i.e. in inaction, he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷.' This explanation is not logical, because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable, and the utterance of the Lord in the sentence, '৷৷.by knowing which you will become freed from evil', will be contradicted. How? Even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nitya-karmas, it cannot, however, follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results. For it has not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of the nityakarmas (themselves), leads to the result of freedom from evil. Nor has this been stated here by the Lord Himself. Hery is refuted the 'seeing of action in inaction' [As explained by others.-Tr.], for (according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in inaction' has not been enjoined here [Here, in the present verse.] as a duty, but (what has been enjoined is) merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory. Moreover, no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from non-performance of nityakramas. Nor even has non-performance of nityakarmas. been enjoined as something that should be known. Besides, such results as freedom from evil, wisdom, engagement in yoga, and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction. Nor is this a eulogy of false perception. [The stated results accrue from correct knowledge, not from false perception; and correct knowledge alone is praise-worthy.] Indeed, false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring about liberation from another evil? Surely, darkness does not become the remover of darkness! Opponent: Well, the seeing of inaction in action, or the seeing of action in inaction-that is not a false perception. Vadantin: What then? Opponent: It is a figurative statement based on the existence or the non-existence of results. Vedantin: Not so, because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action, even in a figurative sense. Besides, nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the scriptures) and imagining something that is not. Further, it was possible (for the Lord) to express in His own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas, and that by their non-performance one would have to go to hell. Under such circumstances, what was the need of the ambiguous statement, 'He who sees inaction in action,' etc., which is misleading to others? This being the case, such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the Lord as meant for deluding people. Moreover, this subject-matter (performance of nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with mystifying words. It is not even logical to say that the subject-matter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words. For, the subject-matter that was stated more clearly in, 'Your right is for action alone' (2.47), does not need any repetition. And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood; anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known. Besides, neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing. Nor even can any evil, which is an entity, arise from the non-performance of nityakarmas, which is a non-entity, for there is the statement, 'Of the unreal there is no being' (2.16), and (in the Upanisad) it has been pointed out, 'How can existence originate from nonexistence?' (Ch. 4.2.2). Since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied, therefore anyone's assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! And that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge. Further, the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions, they being naturally painful; and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally. Also, if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their non-performance (i.e. of the nityakarmas), then that too is surely a source of evil. In either case, whether one undertakes them or not, the scriptures will be imagined to be useless. And there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when, after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless, you assert that they lead to Liberation. Therefore, the meaning of 'He who finds inaction in action,' etc. is just what stands out literally. And the verse has been explained by us accordingly. The aforesaid perception of 'inaction in action,' etc. is being praised:"

      "English": "4.18 Here by the term 'non-action', the knowledge of the self, which is distinct from action and which forms the subject under consideration, is meant. 'He who sees non-action in action and also action in non-action,' denotes him who can perceive knowledge of the self even while action is being performed and who can also perceive action while engaged in non-action, i.e., knowledge of the self. What is the import of this saying? What is taught here is this: One can perceive, by constant contemplation on the truth about the self, that the action that is being performed in itself is a form of knowledge. One can also perceive that this knowledge is also of the form of Karma because of its being contained in Karma Yoga. Both these (i.e., action in the form of knowledge and knowledge in the form of actions) are accomplished by contemplation on the true nature of the self, even while work is being performed. Thus, he who can see actions as included in contemplation on the reality of the self, is wise, i.e., he knows the full meaning of the Sastras; he is fit among men, i.e., fit to attain release. He alone has fulfilled all actions, i.e., carried out the entire purpose of the Sastras. [The purport is that no contradiction between knowledge and action is felt by one who knows the philosophy of the self]. How is the form of knowledge accomplished through works which are obviously activities that are being performed? Sri Krsna explains:"

(Some translate it as desire, hope.-Tr.)], solicitations, have departed; yata-citta-atma, who has the mind and organs under control-one by whom have been controlled (yatau) both the internal organ (citta) and the external aggregate of body and organs (atma); (and) is tyakta-sarva-parigrahah, [ Parigraha: receiving, accepting, possessions, belongings.-V.S.A] totally without possessions- one by whom have been renounced (tyaktah) all (sarvah) possessions (parigrahah); na apnoti, he does not incur; kilbisam, sin, in the form of evil as also rigtheousness-to one aspiring for Liberation, even righteousness is surely an evil because it brings bondage-; [Here Ast. adds tasmat tabhyam mukto bhavati samsarat mukto bhavati ityarthah, therefore, he becomes free from both of them, i.e. he becomes liberated from transmigration.-Tr.] kurvan, by performing; karma, actions; kevalam, merely; sariram, for the purpose of maintaining the body-without the idea of agenship even with regard to these (actions). Further, in the expression, 'kevalam sariram karma', do the words sariram karma mean 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body? Again, what does it matter if by (the words) sariram karma is meant 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaning the body? The answer is: If by sariram karma is meant actions done by the body, then it will amount to a contradiction [Contradiction of the scriptures.] when the Lord says, 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body any action meant for seen or unseen purposes, even though it be prohibited.' Even if the Lord were to say that 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body some scripturally sanctioned action intended to secure a seen or an unseen end', then there arises the contingency of His denying something (some evil) that has not come into being! (Further,) from the specification, sariram karma kurvan (by doing actions with the body), and from the use of the word kevala (only), it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions, called righteous and unrighteous, which can be accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition. Even there, the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction; even in the case of doing what is prohibited, it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact. On the other hand, when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically, orally, or mentally, which are known from injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and which have in view seen or unseen results; while he appears to people to be working with those very body (speech) etc. merely for the purpose of maintaining the body, yet he does not incur sin by merely making movements of the body etc., because from the use of the word kevala, (merely) it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea, 'I do.' Since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin, therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration. That is to say, he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom. This verse is only a reiteration of the result of full illumination stated earlier. It becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus. In the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions, since owning food etc. meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent, therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc. for the upkeep of the body. Under this circumstance, by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc. for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text, 'What comes unasked for, without forethought and spontaneously৷৷.' [Unasked for: what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms; without forethought: alms that are not given with abuses, and have not fallen on the ground, but collected from five or seven houses without any plan; spontaneously: alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people.] (Bo. Sm. 21. 8. 12) etc., the Lord says:"

One who is thus engaged in bodily work alone as long as he lives, does not incur any sin, i.e., does not get engrossed in Samsara.

करता है उस साधनको ब्रह्मरूप ही देखा करता है अर्थात् आत्माके सिवा उसका अभाव देखता है। जैसे ( सीपको जाननेवाला ) सीपमें चाँदीका अभाव देखता है ब्रह्म ही अर्पण है इस पदसे भी वही बात कही जाती है। अर्थात् जैसे यह समझता है कि जो चाँदीके रूपमें दीख रही है वह सीप ही है। ( वैसे ही ब्रह्मवेत्ता भी समझता है कि जो अर्पण दीखता है वह ब्रह्म ही है ) ब्रह्म और अर्पण यह दोनों पद अलगअलग हैं। अभिप्राय यह कि संसारमें जो अर्पण माने जाते हैं वे स्रुक् स्रुव आदि सब पदार्थ उस ब्रह्मवेत्ताकी दृष्टिमें ब्रह्म ही हैं। वैसे ही जो वस्तु हविरूपसे मानी जाती है वह भी उसकी दृष्टिमें ब्रह्म ही होता है। ब्रह्माग्नौ यह पद समासयुक्त है। इसलिये यह अर्थ हुआ कि ब्रह्मरूप कर्ताद्वारा जिसमें हवन किया जाता है वह अग्नि भी ब्रह्म ही है और वह कर्ता भी ब्रह्म ही है और जो उसके द्वारा हवनरूप क्रिया की जाती है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। उस ब्रह्मकर्ममें स्थित हुए पुरुषद्वारा प्राप्त करनेयोग्य जो फल है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। अर्थात् ब्रह्मरूप कर्ममें जिसके चित्तका समाधान हो चुका है उस पुरुषद्वारा प्राप्त किये जानेयोग्य जो फल है वह भी ब्रह्म ही है। इस प्रकार लोकसंग्रह करना चाहनेवाले पुरुषद्वारा किये हुए कर्म भी ब्रह्मबुद्धिसे बाधित होनेके कारण अर्थात् फल उत्पन्न करनेकी शक्तिसे रहित कर दिये जानेके कारण वास्तवमें अकर्म ही हैं। ऐसा अर्थ मान लेनेपर कर्मोंको छोड़ देनेवाले कर्म संन्यासीके ज्ञानको भी यथार्थ ज्ञानकी स्तुतिके लिये यज्ञरूप समझना भली प्रकार बन सकता है अधियज्ञमें जो स्रुवादि वस्तुएँ प्रसिद्ध हैं वे सब इस यथार्थ ज्ञानी संन्यासीके ( सम्यक्ज्ञानरूप ) अध्यात्मयज्ञमें ब्रह्म ही हैं। उपर्युक्त अर्थ नहीं माननेसे वास्तवमें सब ही ब्रह्मरूप होनेके कारण केवल स्रुव आदिको ही विशेषतासे ब्रह्मरूप बतलाना व्यर्थ होगा। सुतरां यह सब कुछ ब्रह्म ही है इस प्रकार समझनेवाले ज्ञानीके लिये वास्तवमें सब कर्मोंका अभाव ही हो जाता है। तथा उसके अन्तःकरणमें ( क्रिया फल आदि ) कारकसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिका अभाव होनेके कारण भी यही सिद्ध होता है क्योंकि कोई भी यज्ञ नामक कर्म कारकसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिसे रहित नहीं देखा गया। अभिप्राय यह है कि अग्निहोत्रादि सभी कर्म ( इन्द्राय वरुणाय आदि ) शब्दोंद्वारा हवि आदि द्रव्य जिनके अर्पण किये जाते हैं उन देवताविशेषरूप सम्प्रदान आदि कारकबुद्धिवाले तथा कर्तापनके अभिमानसे और फलकी इच्छासे युक्त देखे गये हैं। जिसमेंसे क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी हो तथा जो कर्तापनके अभिमानसे और फलकी इच्छासे रहित हो ऐसा यज्ञ नहीं देखा गया। परंतु यह उपर्युक्त कर्म तो ऐसा है कि जिसमें सर्वत्र ब्रह्मबुद्धि हो जानेके कारण अर्पणादि कारक क्रिया और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी है। इसलिये यह अकर्म ही है। यही बात कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येत् कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किंचित्करोति सः गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्ते नैव किंचित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् इत्यादि श्लोकोंद्वारा भी दिखलायी गयी है। और इसी प्रकार दिखलाते हुए भगवान् जगहजगह क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धिका निषेध कर रहे हैं। देखा भी गया है कि सकाम अग्निहोत्रादिमें कामना न रहनेपर वे सकाम अग्निहोत्रादि नहीं रहते। ( उनकी सकामता नष्ट हो जाती है। ) तथा यह भी देखा गया है कि जानबूझकर किये हुए और अनजानमें किये हुए कर्म भिन्नभिन्न कार्योंके आरम्भक होते हैं अर्थात् उनका फल अलगअलग होता है। वैसे ही यहाँ भी जिस पुरुषकी सर्वत्र ब्रह्मबुद्धि हो जानेसे ( स्रुव हवि आदिमें ) क्रिया कारक और फलसम्बन्धी भेदबुद्धि नष्ट हो गयी है उस ज्ञानी पुरुषके बाह्य चेष्टामात्रसे होनेवाले कर्म भी अकर्म हो जाते हैं। इसलिये कहा है कि उसके फलसहित कर्म विलीन हो जाते हैं। इस विषयमें कोईकोई टीकाकार कहते हैं कि जो ब्रह्म है वही स्रुव आदि है अर्थात् ब्रह्म ही स्रुव आदि पाँच प्रकारके कारकोंके रूपमें स्थित है और वही कर्म किया करता है ( उनके सिद्धान्तानुसार ) उपर्युक्त यज्ञमें स्रुव आदि बुद्धि निवृत्त नहीं की जाती किंतु स्रुव आदिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि स्थापित की जाती है जैसे कि मूर्ति आदिमें विष्णु आदि देवबुद्धि या नाम आदिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि की जाती है। ठीक है यदि यह प्रकरण ज्ञानयज्ञकी स्तुतिके लिये न होता तो यह अर्थ भी हो सकता था। परंतु इस प्रकरणमें तो यज्ञ नामसे कहे जानेवाले अलगअलग बहुतसे क्रियाभेदोंको कहकर फिर द्रव्यमय यज्ञकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानयज्ञ कल्याणकर है इस कथनद्वारा ज्ञानयज्ञ शब्दसे कथित सम्यक् दर्शनकी स्तुति करते हैं। तथा इस प्रकरणमें जो ब्रह्मार्पणम् इत्यादि वचन है यह ज्ञानको यज्ञरूपसे सम्पादन करनेमें समर्थ भी है नहीं तो वास्तवमें सब कुछ ब्रह्मरूप होनेके कारण केवल अर्पण ( स्रुव ) आदिको ही अलग करके ब्रह्मरूपसे विधान करना व्यर्थ होगा। जो ऐसा कहते हैं कि यहाँ मूर्तिमें विष्णु आदिकी दृष्टिके सदृश या नामादिमें ब्रह्मबुद्धिकी भाँति अर्पण ( स्रुव ) आदि यज्ञकी सामग्रीमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि स्थापन करायी गयी है उनकी दृष्टिसे सम्भवतः इस प्रकरणमें ब्रह्मविद्या नहीं कही गयी है क्योंकि ( उनके मतानुसार ) ज्ञानका विषय स्रुव आदि यज्ञकी सामग्री ही है ब्रह्म नहीं। इस प्रकार केवल ब्रह्मदृष्टि सम्पादनरूप ज्ञानसे मोक्षरूप फल नहीं मिल सकता और यहाँ ( स्पष्ट ही ) यह कहा है कि उसके द्वारा प्राप्त किया जानेवाला फल ब्रह्म ही है फिर बिना यथार्थ ज्ञानके मोक्षरूप फल मिलता है यह कहना सर्वथा विपरीत है। इसके सिवा ( ऐसा मान लेनेसे ) प्रकरणमें भी विरोध आता है। अभिप्राय यह है कि जो कर्ममें अकर्म देखता है इस प्रकार यहाँ आरम्भमें सम्यक् ज्ञानका ही प्रकरण है तथा उसीमें उपसंहार होनेके कारण अन्तमें भी यथार्थ ज्ञानका ही प्रकरण है। क्योंकि द्रव्यमय यज्ञकी अपेक्षा ज्ञानयज्ञ श्रेष्ठतर है ज्ञानको पाकर परम शान्तिको तुरंत ही प्राप्त हो जाता है इत्यादि वचनोंसे यथार्थ ज्ञानकी स्तुति करते हुए ही यह अध्याय समाप्त हुआ है। फिर बिना प्रकरण अकस्मात् मूर्तिमें विष्णुदृष्टिकी भाँति स्रुव आदिमें ब्रह्मदृष्टिका विधान बतलाना उपयुक्त नहीं। सुतरां जिस प्रकार इसकी व्याख्या की गयी है इस श्लोकका अर्थ वैसा ही है।",

He perceives it as not existing separately from the Self, as one sees the non-existence of silver in nacre. In this sense it is that Brahman Itself is the ladle-just as what appears as silver is only narcre. (The two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word, samasa.) The meaning is that, to a knower of Brahman, what is perceived in the world as ladle is Brahman Itself. Similarly, brahma-havih, the oblations is Brahman: To him, what is seen as oblations is nothing but Brahman. In the same way, brahma-agnau, (-this is a compound word-) in the fire of Brahman: The fire into which oblation is hutam, poured; brahmana, by Brahman, by the agent, is Brahman Itself. The meaning is that Brahman Itself is the agent (of the offering). That he makes the offering-the act of offering-, that is also Brahman. And the result that is gantavyam, to be reached by him; that also is brahma eva, surely Brahman. Brahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective (karma); he who has concentration (samadhi) on That is brahma-karma-samdhih. The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone. Thus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman. This being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his Knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization. That is, whatever is well known as ladle etc. in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the Self, is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth. If not so, then, since all in Brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc. as Brahman. Therefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this. And this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories. [See note on p.211.-Tr.] For the act called 'sacarifice' is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories. All such acts as Agnihotra etc. are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc. to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results. But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results. This (apparent) (activity of the man of Knowledge), however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc., actions and results, which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman. Hence, it is inaction to be sure. And thus has it been shown in, 'He who finds inaction in action' (18), 'he really does not do anything even though engaged in action' (20), 'the organs act on the objects of the organs' (3.28), 'Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, \"I certainly do not do anything\"' (5.8), etc. While pointing out thus, the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results. And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya), that the Agnihotra etc. cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed. Similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results. So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction. Hence it was said, 'gets totally destroyed.' Here some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle etc. It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz Nominative, Objective, Instrumental, Dative and Locative. (As for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and Brahman.-Tr.) of accessories such as the ladle etc. and it is Itself which undertakes actions. There the ideas of ladle etc. are not eradicated, but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle etc. as one does the ideas of Visnu etc. to images etc., or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name etc. Reply: True, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice). Here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' (33). And in the present context, this statement, 'the ladle is Brahman' etc., is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise, since Brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc. as Brahman. But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc., like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images etc. and of Brahman on name etc., for them the knowledge of Brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle etc. are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse). Besides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is, 'Brahman alone in to be realized by him'. Also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization. And it goes against the context-the context being of full realization. This is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse, 'He who finds inaction in action,' and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter. The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, 'Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials', 'Achieving Knowledge, one৷৷.attains supreme Peace,' (39) etc. That being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc. like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images. Therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained. As to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, '(Other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone,' etc., for eulogizing that Knowledge:"

      "English": "4.24 The expression 'Brahman is the instrument to offer with' (It is to be remembered that in Ramanuja's system 'Brahman' in the primary sense is the 'Whole' with the Supreme Being as the Soul and Atmans and Matter (Prakrti) as His body in inseparable union with the Whole. So the word 'Brahman' can, according to the needs of each context, be used to indicate the Supreme Being, the Atman, or Prakrti; In verse 24 it has been used in all these senses. We have therefore put it in italics. See Introduction.) is adjectival to 'the oblation'. That by which an offering is given, such as a ladle, is an Arpana. It is called Brahman because it is an effect of Brahman, Brahman being the material cause of the universe. 'Brahmaarpanam' is the oblation, of which the instrument is Brahman. The oblation, just like the instrument with which it is offered, is also Brahman. It is offered by the agent Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He is the Brahma-karma-samadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the Supreme Brahman or as having the Supreme Brahman as the Self. He who contemplates on Brahman as the Soul of all actions, reaches Brahman alone, as his own self has the Supreme Brahman as Its Self. The meaning is that the individual self - which is Brahman because of Its having Brahman as Its Self - has to realise Its own real nature. All actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman as their self. They are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of Jnana Yoga. Thus, Sri Krsna, after explaining how Karma takes the form of knowledge, now speaks of the various kinds of Karma Yoga."

Kumbhaka (stoppage of breath) is that when the flow of both inward and outward breaths is stopped. The clause, restricting of diet, applies to all the three types of persons devoted to the control of breath. All these, according to their liking and capacity are engaged in performing the various kinds of Karma Yoga beginning from the sacrifice of material objects to the control of breath. They know and are devoted to sacrifices comprising obligatory and occasional rituals preceded by the performance of 'the great sacrifices' (Panca-Maha-Yajna), as alluded to in 'Creating men along with the sacrifices' (3.10). Because of this only, their sins are done away with. Those who are engaged in Karma Yoga by sustaining their bodies only by the ambrosia of sacrificial remains will go to the eternal Brahman.

Hence, Knowledge reduces to ashes only all those actions that were done (in this life) prior to the rise of Knowledge and that have not become effective, as also those performed along with (i.e. after the dawn of) Knowledge, and those that were done in the many past lives. Since this is so, therefore,"

The independence of Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga from each other as means for attainment of the self is now declared."

Therefore his senses are subdued. His self is said to have become the self of all beings. Because of his being devoted to contemplation on the true nature of the self, he finds that his self is similar to the self of all beings like gods etc. One who contemplates on the true nature of the self understands that all selves are of the same form or nature. The distinctions obtaining among gods, men etc., cannot pertain to the form of the self, because those distinctions are founded on particular modifications of Prakrti i.e., the bodies of beings. Sri Krsna will teach: 'For the Brahman (an individual self), when untainted, is the same everywhere' (5.19). The meaning of this is that when dissociated from the Prakriti, i.e., the body, the self is of the same nature everywhere, i.e., in the bodies of gods, men etc. It is of the same form of knowledge. The meaning is that one, who has become enlightened in this way, active though he be, is not tainted on account of erroneously conceiving what is other than the self (the body) as the self. He is not at all associated therewith. Therefore, he attains the self without any delay.

Just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water, actions do not affect or defile a person with sin, if he is free from such identification with the body."

      "English": "5.13 Aste, he continues; sukham, happily; sannyasya, having given up; sarva-karmani, all actions-nitya, naimittika, kamya and nisiddha (prohibited actions); [See note on p. 128.-Tr.] manasa, mentally, through discriminating wisdom-i.e. having given up (all actions) by seeing inaction in action, etc. Freed from the activities of speech, mind and body, effortles, placid in mind, and devoid of all external wants which are different from the Self, he continues happily. This is what has been said. Where and how does the vasi, man of self-control, i.e. one who has his organs under control, remain? This is being answered: Nava-dvare pure, in the town with nine gates, of which seven [Two ears, two eyes nostrils, and mouth.] are in the head for one's own experiences, and two are below for urination and defecation. As possessed of those gates, it is called the 'town with nine gates'. Being like a town, the body is called a town with the Self as its only master. And it is inhabited by the organs, mind, intellect and objects, like citizens, as it were, which serve its needs and which are productive of many results and experience. Renouncing all actions, the dehi, embodied one, resides in that town with nine gates. Objection: What is the need of this specification? For all embodied beings, be they monks or not, reside in bodies to be sure! That being so, the specification is needless. The answer is: The embodied one, however, who is unenlightened, who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the Self, he, in his totality, thinks, 'I am in a house, on the ground, or on the seat.' For one who experiences the body alone as the Self, there can certainly be no such conviction as, 'I am in the body, like one's being in a house.' But, for one who realizes the Self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc. it becomes reasonable to have the conviction, 'I am in the bdoy. It is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom, there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others, which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme Self. Even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions, there can be, like staying in a house, the continuance in the body itself-the town with nine gates-as a conseence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit, because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one is in the body itself. Form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened persons, the alifying words, 'He continues in the body itself', do have a purpose to serve. Although it has been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the Self, still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the Self. Anticipating this, the Lord says: na eva kurvan, without himself doing anything at all; and na karayan, not causing (others) to do, (not) inducing the body and organs to activity. Objection: Is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the Self and ceases to be after renunciation, as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? Or, is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the Self? As to this, the answer is: The Self by Its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship. For it was stated, 'It is said that৷৷.This (Self) is unchangeable' (2.25). 'O son of Kunti, although existing in the body, It does not act, nor is It affected' (13.31). And it is also stated in the Upanisad, 'It seems to meditate, as it were; It seems to move, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7)."

For this reason It does not take away or remove the evil or suffering of anyone such as a son who is related and therefore dear to one; nor does It take away, i.e., remove the happiness of anyone whom It deems with aversion. All this is the effect of Vasanas or subtle impressions of Prakrti. How does do these contrary Vasanas originte in the case of one whose intrinsic nature is a described above? In answer it is said that knowledge is enveloped by the darkness of ignorance. The Atman's knowledge is enveloped, i.e., contracted by preceding Karmas which are opposed to knowledge, so that a person may be alified to experience the fruits of his own Karma. It is by this Karma, which contracts knowledge, and can join the Jiva with the bodies of gods etc., that the misconception that the bodies are the selves is produced. Conseently there will originate the Vasanas or the unconscious subtle impressions born of such misapprehension of the self and the inclination to undertake actions corresponding to them. Sri Krsna now brings into proper seence what has been taught before in the following verses: 'You will completely cross over the sea of all your sins with the boat of knowledge' (4.36), and 'The fire of knowledge reduces all Karmas to ashes in the same way' (4.37), and 'For there is no purifier here eal to knowledge' (4.38)."

      "English": "5.16 While all these selves are thus deluded, in the case of enlightened souls, their delusive ignorance - which envelops knowledge and which is of the form of accumulated, beginningless and endless Karma - is destroyed by knowledge. As already described this knowledge is produced by the teachings of the scriptures about the real nature of the self, which are enriched by daily practice. The purity of this knowledge is unexcelled. And in the case of those selves who regain the knowledge that is natural to Them, it is found that it is unlimited and uncontracted and illumining everything like the sun. Plurality of the selves in Their essence is expressly mentioned in the case of those whose ignorance is overcome, in the expression 'for those' in the text. What was stated at the commencement, 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (2.12) is expressed here with greater clarity. Moreover, this plurality is not due to limiting adjuncts imposed on a single universal self. For, as stated here, there cannot be any trace of such adjuncts for those whose ignorance is destroyed, and still They are described as a plurality. Hence knowledge is taught as an attribute inseparable from the essential nature of the self, because a difference between the self and its knowledge is made out in the statement, 'Knowledge, in their case illuminates like the sun'. By the illustration of the sun, the relation of the knower to his knowledge is brought out to be similar to the luminous object and its luminosity. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand that knowledge contracts by Karma in the stage of Samsara and expands in the stage of Moksa (release). [In this system the Atman has two forms of Jnana or Knowledge - Dharmi-Jnana (self-awareness) and Dharma-bhuta-Jnana (awareness of objects other than itself). It is the latter that is contracted by ignorance and expands by knowledge. See Intrdocution.]  English Translation Of Sri Sankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda 5.16 Tu, but; yesam, in the case of those creatures; of whom tat ajnanam, that ignorance; atmanah, of theirs-being covered by which ignorance creatures get deluded-; nasitam, becomes destroyed; jnanena, by knowledge, by discriminating knowledge concerning the Self; tesam, their; jnanam, knowledge; adityavat, like the sun; prakasayati, reveals, in the same way as the sun reveals all forms whatever; tat-param, that supreme Reality, the Reality which is the highest Goal, the totality of whatever is to be known."

He who craves for the results of actions becomes dependent on the results of actions. But this person is the opposite of such a one. Hence (it is said), 'wihtout depending on the result of action. Having become so, yah he who; karoti, performs accomplishes; (karma, an action;) which is his karyam, duty, the nityakarmas such as Agnihotra etc. which are opposed to the kamya-karmas-. Whoever is a man of action of this kind is distinguished from the other men of action. In order to express this idea the Lord says, sah, he ; is a sannyasi, monk, and a yogi.

Objection: Is it not only with regard to one who does not keep a fire and is acitonless that monasticsm and meditativeness are well known in the Vedas, Smrtis and scriptures dealing with meditation? Why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of action-which is not accepted as a fact? Reply: This defect does not arise, because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense. Objection: How is that? Reply: His being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions; and his being a man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from his rejection of thoughts for the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind. Thus both are used in a figurative sense. On the contrary, it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense. With a veiw to pointing out this idea, the Lord says:"

Accepting what kind of similarity between Karma-yoga, which is characterized by engagement (in actions), and its opposite, renunciation in the real sense, which is characterized by cessation from work, has their eation been stated? When such an apprehension arises, the answer is this; From the point of view of the agent, there does exist a simialrity of Karma-yoga with real renunciation. For he who is a monk in the real sense, from the very fact of his having given up all the means needed for accomplishing actions, gives up the thought of all actions and their results-the source of desire that leads to engagement in work. [Thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it, which in turn leads to actions for getting it. (Also see note under 4.19)] also, even while performing actions, gives up the thought for results. Pointing out this idea, the Lord says: Hi, for; kascit, nobody, no man of action whosoever; asannyasta-sankalpah, who has not given up expactaions-one by whom has not been renounced expectation, anticipation, of results;bhavati, becomes, i.e. can become; yogi, a yogi, a man of concentration, because thought of results is the cause of the disturbance of mind. Therefore, any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi, a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind, because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions. This is the purport. Thus, because of the similarity of real monasticism with Karma-yoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent, Karma-yoga is extolled as monasticism in, 'That which they call monasticism, know that to be Yoga, O Pandava.' Since Karma-yoga, which is independent of results, is the remote help to Dhyana-yoga, therefore it has been praised as monasticism. Thereafter, now the Lord shows how Karma-yoga is helpful to Dhyana-yoga:"

From the expression, 'one who has given up thought about eveything', it follows that one has to renounce all desires and all actions, for all desires have thoughts as their source. This accords with such Smrti texts as: 'Verily, desire has thought as its source. Sacrifices arise from thoughts' (Ma. Sm. 2.3); 'O Desire, I know your source. You surely spring from thought. I shall not think of you. So you will not arise in me' (Mbh. Sa. 177.25). And when one gives up all desires, renunciation of all actions becomes accomplished. This agrees with such Upanisadic texts as, '(This self is identified with desire alone.) What it desires, it resolves; what it resolves, it works out' (Br. 4.4.5); and also such Smrti texts as, 'Whatever actions a man does, all that is the effect of desire itself' (Ma. Sm. 2.4). It accords with reason also. For, when all thoughts are renounced, no one can even move a little. So, by the expression, 'one who has given up thought about everything', the Lord makes one renounced all desires and all actions.

Its addiction to sense objects is the cause of his bondage; its separation from sense objects is the means of one's release' (V. P., 6.7.28). The proper condition for the beginning of Yoga is now taught:"

In, 'Making the mind fixed in the Self' (25), the Lord will speak of concentrating the mind verily on the Self.

Va, and-the word va is (used) in the sense of and; just as yadi, whatever; duhkham, sorrow is unfavourable, unwelcome to me, so also is sorrow unwelcome and unfavourable to all creatures. In this way, he looks upon happiness and sorrow as pleasant and unpleasant to all bengs, by the same standard as he would apply to himself. He does not act against anyone. That is , he is non-injurious. He who is thus non-injurious and steadfast in full Illumination, sah, that yogi; paramah matah, is considered as the best among all the yogis. Noticing that his Yoga-as spoken of and consisting in full Illumination- is hard to acire, Arjuna, with a view to hearing the sure means to its attainment, said:"

In the verses beginning with, 'He sees the self as abiding in all beings' (6.29), Yogins at four degrees of attainment have been mentioned. Since the Yogin who is now mentioned in this passage cannot be included in the four types mentioned earlier, the genitive case specifying one out of many will be inappropriate here. In 'api sarvesam,' those who practise austerities etc., are referred to by the word 'sarva' (all). According to the principle set forth, here also the case ending has to be taken as ablative. The meaning therefore is that the Yogin who is now referred to, is the most integrated compared with those mentioned earlier and all other types. Compared to this Yogin, the differences in point of superiority and inferiority among the other Yogins such as the performers of austerities etc., are of no significance like mustard-seeds compared to Mount Meru. Even though there exists smallness and bigness in relation to one another among mustard-seeds, still when compared to Meru, such distinctions among them have no significance, as they are all small compared to Meru. I consider him the most integrated who, with his innermost self, has his mind fixed on Me, on account of My being the only object of his overflowing love and also on account of his having a nature which cannot be supported by anything other than Myself; who has 'faith,' i.e., who strives rapidly to attain Me because of his being unable to bear a moment's separation from Me on account of My being very dear to him; and who 'worships Me,' i.e., serves Me with devotion and meditates on Me - Me whose sportive delight brings about the origination, sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos filled with multifarious and innumerable objects of enjoyment, enjoyers, means and places of enjoyment; who is untouched by any evil without exception; whose divine figure is the treasue-house of innumerable multitudes of auspicious, unlimited and unsurpassed attributes such as knowledge, power, lordship, energy, potency and splendour; whose divine figure is the treasure-house of infinite, unsurpassed attributes agreeable and highly worthy, such as radiance, beauty, fragrance, tenderness, pervading sweetness and youthfulness which are uniform, inconceivable and divine, wondrous, eternal and flawless; whose essential nature and alities transcend all thought and words; who is the great ocean of compassion, condescension, paternal love and beauty; who is the impartial refuge of all beings without exception and without considerations of any difference; who is the reliever of the distress of supplicants; who is the great, unfathomable ocean of affection for supplicants; who has become visible to the eyes of all men without abandoning His essential nature; who has incarnated in the house of Vasudeva; who has made the entire would illumined with His limitless and excellent glory; and who has satisfied the entire universe with the impeccable glory of beauty.

This controllership over inanimate nature is exercised through the animate Prakrti (the Jivas) who form the inner controller (Sesin) of their bodies which are constituted of inanimate nature. 2) I am supreme to all in another sense also - as the possessor of knowledge, power, strength etc., in an infinite degree. There is no entity other than Me with such attributes of an eal or superior nature. The aggregate of all the animate and inanimate things, whether in their causal state or in the state of effect, is strung on Me who abides as their Self, as a row of gems on a thread. They depend on Me. And it is proved that the universe of inanimate and animate beings exists as the body with Brahman (i.e. the Supreme Person) as their Self as declared by the Antaryami-brahmana and other texts: 'He whose body is the earth' (Br. U., 3.7-3), 'He whose body is the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22), and 'He is the inner self of all beings, without evil, He is the Lord in the supreme heaven, He is the one Narayana' (Su. U., 7). Thus, as everything constitutes the body of the Supreme Person forming only a mode of His who is their Self, the Supreme Person alone exists, and all things (which we speak of as diversity) are only His modes. Therefore all terms used in common parlance for different things, denote Him only. Sri Krsna shows this by coordinating some important ones among these entities with Himself."

Because it is created by Me, the Divine, for purpose of sport, it is divine in its power and therefore difficult to overcome. The word Maya is used for the effects of the three Gunas, because it has got the power of generating wonderful effects as in the case of the magic of Asuras and Raksasas. See the passages: 'Then the excellent discus, the flaming Sudarsana, was despatched by the Lord to defend the boy. The thousand Mayas or wonderfully created weapons of the evil-designed Sambara were foiled one after another, by that ickly moving discus, for protecting the body of the boy' (V. P., 1.19. 19-20). Here the term Maya does not signify the sense of 'false'. Even with regard to magicians, when the term, Mayavin (one who possesses Maya) is used, there is origination of real impressions with the aid of certain incantations, herbs etc., though the objects created are illusory things. Accordingly the term Maya denotes the incantations, herbs etc., which have got the power of creating real impressions. Inasmuch as the sense of the term should be invariable, following the usage in all cases, the term Maya can be applied to the illusory objects, only in a secondary sense, while its primary sense in regard to the real impressions generated in the mind. It is just like in the statement 'The cots cry.' The Maya of the Lord, which is absolutely real and which consists of the Gunas, is alone taught in the texts like, 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the possessor of the Maya to be the great Lord' (Sve. U., 4.10). It not only obscures the essential nature of the Lord but also creates the condition of the mind that sees its objects as enjoyable. Therefore, the entire universe, deluded by the Lord's Maya, does not know the Lord who is of the nature of boundless beatitude. (On the other hand they feel objects set forth by Maya as enjoyable). Sri Krsna teaches the way of deliverance from Maya: (b) But those who take refuge in Me alone - Me whose resolves are always true, who has supreme compassion, and who is the refuge of all beings without exception and without consideration of their particular status - such persons shall pass beyond this Maya of Mine consisting of the three Gunas. The meaning is that they worship Me alone, renouncing the Maya. Why, then do all not take recourse to refuge in the Lord which is conducive to the worship of the Lord?"

Hence he, the man of knowledge, alone is the foremost. Further I am very dear to the man of knowledge.

For, those who receive from Me anything, however small they are, I consider them as contributing everything to Me (and thus as benefactors). But I deem the man of knowledge to be My very self. I consider Myself as depending on him for My support. Why is it so? Because this person considers Me to be the highest and finds it impossible to support himself without Me; I also find it impossible to be without him. Thus, verily, he is My self. The attainment of this state of mind reires innumerable auspicious births. It is attained after gaining the knowledge of the real nature of the self and the self feels that Its happiness consists in being a dependant (Sesa) of Myself."

      "English": "7.19 Further after passing through innumerable auspicious births, one gets the knowledge: 'I find my sole joy as a Sesa of Vasudeva. I find my essence, existence and activities to be dependent on Him. He is superior over all others on account of His innumerable auspicious attributes.' Conseent to this knowledge he resorts to Me, i.e., meditates on Me, realising, 'Vasudeva alone is my highest end and also the means for attaining it, and whatever other desire remains in the mind, He alone is all that too for me'. Such a great-souled person, i.e., great-minded man is hard to find. It is very hard to find such persons in this world. This is the only meaning of the statement that 'Vasudeva is all,' because of the topic having been begun with the statements: 'For I am very dear to the man of knowledge' (7.17) and 'For he, integrated, is devoted to Me alone as the highest end' (7.18). It is so, also because that Jnanin whose traits are given here, possesses the same alities as the man of knowledge described earlier. For, it has been said that the two Prakrtis, the animate and the inanimate, have their sole essence in being the Sesa (dependants) of the Supreme Person in the verses beginning with 'Earth, water' (7.4) and ending with, 'Ego-sense, thus My Prakrti is divided eightfold. This is my lower (Prakrti). But know that which is other than this (lower nature) and forms the life-principle to be the higher Prakrti' (7.4-5). Then take the beginning from 'I am the origin and dissolution of the whole universe. There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna' (7.6-7), and ending with, 'Know that all the states of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are from Me alone. But I am not in them. They are in Me' (7.12). It has been declared in these texts that the two Prakrtis, both in their states of cause and effect, depend upon Him for their essence, existence and activities and that the Supreme Person is superior to everything in all respects. Therefore the knower of this truth alone is here spoken of as a man of knowledge or as one knowing 'All this is Vasudeva.' [The purpose of this explanation is to eliminate any pure monistic slant to this passage.] Sri Krsna now explains the rarity of finding such a person of knowledge.

(Creatures are duluded) by that. By what? When that is thus sought to be known in particular, the Lord answers: dvandva-mohena, by the delusion of duality. Delusion (moha) that originates from duality (advandva) is dvandva-moha. Those very likes and dislikes, which are mutually opposed like heat and cold, which relate to happiness and sorrow and their causes, and which come into association with all beings in due course, are termed as duality (and this deludes all creatures). As regards them, when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of happiness, sorrow and their causes, then, by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control, they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of Self, the suprem Truth. Indeed, exact knowledg about objects even in the external world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects, viz likes and dislikes. It goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling Self, beset with many obstacles as it is, does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them. Therefore, bharata, O scion of the Bharata dynasty; owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, sarvabhutani, all creatures become deluded. Parantapa, O destroyer of foes; they yanti sammoham, become bewildered, come under delusion; sarge, at the time of their birth, i.e. at the time of their origination. The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion. 'Since this is so, therefore all creatures, being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality, do not know Me who am their Self. Hence, they do not adore Me as their Self.' 'Who, again, are those that, becoming free from the delusion of duality, come to know You, and adore You as the Self in accordance with the scriptures?' In order to elaborate the subject enired about, it is being said:"

      "English": "7.27 As soon as beings are born they are deluded. This delusion springs from sense experiences described as pairs of opposites like heat and cold. Such reactions spring from desire and hate. The purport is this: Desire and hatred for the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain, which are constituted of Gunas, have their origin in the Jivas from the past experiences they had in their previous births. The subtle impressions or Vasanas of these previous experiences manifest again as instinctive desire and hatred towards similar objects in every succeeding birth of the Jivas. The delusive force of these impressions make them deluded from the very beginning. It becomes their nature to have love or hatred for such objects, in place of having happiness and misery at union with or separation from Me. The Jnanin, however, feels happiness when he is in union with Me and misery when separated from Me. No other being is born with such a nature as found in the Jnanin."

The Srutis say to this effect: 'The Avyakta is dissolved into the Aksara, the Aksara is dissolved into Tamas' (Su. U., 2). The supreme Aksara is the essential form of the self, separated from Prakrti. One's own material nature (the body) is spoken of as Adhyatma or that which dwells with the self. This material nature (Svabhava) is Prakrti. It does not form the self but attaches itself to the self in the form of subtle elements, impressions etc. This has been taught in the Vidya of Five Fires (Cha. U., 5). Both these (the Aksara and the Adhyatma) should be known by the aspirants for liberation (Kaivalya) - the former as what should be attained and the latter as what should be relinished. Karma is that force which produces the origination of mundane beings. 'Beings' here means beings such as the human beings. The creative force which produces their origination is contact with woman. It has been described in the Sruti passage thus: 'The waters sacrificed in the fifth oblations become those who are named Purusas' (Cha. U., 5.3.3). That creative force is called Karma. All the acts associated with that should be considered by aspirants after release as calling for abstention. This abstention will also be inculcated immediately in the text, 'Desiring which they practise the vow of continence' (8.11)."

Ksarah is that which is mutable, which is destructible; bhavah means anything whatsoever that has orgination. This is meaning. Purusah means the Person, derived in the sense of he by whom all things are pervaded; or, he who lies in every heart. He is Hiranyagarbha, who resides in the Sun and sustains the organs of all creatures. He is adhi-daivatam, the entity existing in the divine plane. Deha-bhrtam-vara, O best among the embodied beings; adhiyajnah, the entity existing in sacrifices, is the Deity, called Visnu, presiding over all sacrifices-which agrees with the Vedic text, 'Sacrifice is indeed Vishu' (Tai, Sam. 1.7.4). Aham eva, I Myself, who am that very Visnu; am adhiyajnah, the entity existing in the sacrifice; which is going on atra dehe, in this body. Since a sacrfice is performed with body, therefore it is closely associated with the body. In this sense it is said to be going on in the body."

      "English": "8.4 The perishable existences which have been declared as fit to be known by the seekers of wealth, power etc., form the Adhibhuta. They are superior material entities that remain in ether or space and other elements. They are the evolutes of material elements and are perishable in their nature. They are also of the nature of sound, touch etc., supported by their basic subtle elements but different from, and finer than, ordinary sound etc., and are of many kinds. Sound, touch, form, taste and smell on this kind, which are manifold and rooted in their several bases, are to be gained by the seekers after prosperity and should be contemplated upon by them. Adhidaivata connotes Purusa. The Purusa is superior to divinities like Indra, Prajapati and others, and is the experiencer of sound etc., which are different from, and superior to, the multitude of enjoyments of Indra, Prajapati etc. The condition of being such an enjoyer is to be contemplated upon by the seekers after prosperity, as the end to be attained. I alone am connoted by the term Adhiyajna (sacrifice). Adhiyajna denotes one who is propitiated in sacrifices. Indra and others, to whom sacrifices are made, form My body. I dwell as their Self and I alone am the object of worship by sacrifice. In this manner the three groups of alified devotees should contemplate at the time of the practice of periodical and occasional rituals like the great sacrificies. This is also common to all the three groups of devotees."

U., 2). The process of involution ends, after passing through all the other stages of dissolution, with the Avyakta, Akasa and Tamas. Therefore, for every other entity except Myself, origination and annihilation are unavoidable. So for those who seek Aisvarya (prosperity and power) birth and dissolution according to the above mentioned time arrangement are unavoidable. But in the case of those who attain to Me, there is no return again to Samsara. [The immense duration of time, according to ancient thinkers, is as follows: Catur-yuga, or a unit of the four yugas of Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali, has a cumulative duration of 4,320,000 human years. A thousand such periods constitute a day time of Brahma and a similar period his night. Periodic creation and dissolution of the universe take place in these two periods respectively. One year of Brahma consists of 360 such diurnal period. A Brahma has a life-span of 100 such years - i.e., 311, 040, 000,000,000 human years. At the end of it, there is a Mahapralaya, and a new Brahma comes into being. Time thus goes on endlessly]. Now Sri Krsna teaches that there is no return to Samsara even for those who have attained Kaivalya (isolation of the self)."

      "English": "8.22 That Supreme Person has been declared in such texts as 'There is nothing higher than Myself, O Arjuna. All this is strung on Me, as rows of gems are on a thread' (7.7), and 'Who am beyond them and immutable' (7.13) - He is the Supreme Person in whom all beings abide and by whom all this is pervaded. He is to be attained by undivided devotion as described in 'Whose mind is not in anything else' (8.14). Now, Sri Krsna teaches the 'path of light,' described in the Srutis which is common to the knowers of the true nature of the self and to the persons who are devoted to the Supreme Person. The nature of this path is alified as one of 'non-return to Samsara.' In the case of a person journeying through the 'path of light,' as described in the text of the worship of Five Fires is as follows: 'So those who know It (i.e., the eternal nature of the individual self) thus, as taught in the Vidya of the Five Fires, and those too who worhip in the forest with faith and Tapas go to the deity ruling over the rays of light, and from there to the deity of the day' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). The attainment of the Supreme Brahman and the non-return to birth are declared with reference to those who go by the path of light, etc., by the teaching that 'He the Supreme Being leads them to Brahman ৷৷. Those who reach by this path do not return to the (wordly) life of man' (Cha. U., 4.15.5). This declaration of the goal in the text, 'Those who know it thus etc.,' is not with reference to the attainment of the Atman which constitutes ony the limb of the science of Brahman as taught in the beginning of Prajapati's teaching. For there will then arise purposelessness for the separate teaching of the same in regard to the principal science of the Supreme in the text. 'Those who are in the forest worship by means of faith and austerity etc.,' (Cha. U., 5.10.1). It is taught in the Vidya (meditation) of Five Fires: 'Thus, indeed, in the fifth oblation the waters become Purusa' (Cha. U., 5.9.1) and 'Those with a balance of good Karmas ৷৷. and those with a balance of bad Karmas' (Ibid., 5.10.7). What is to be understood here is that the state of existence as men and other beings, which has its origin in good and evil Karmas, refer to the 'waters' which alone are mixed with other elements (i.e., to the body-mind); as for the self, there is only contact with them and not identification. Thus, is declared the difference between intelligent self and inanimate matter. Then, by the texts, 'Those who know this' (Ibid., 5.10.1), 'Those who go to the rays of light' (Ibid.), and 'They who proceed by it return not to the human condition here,' it is instructed that those who know this concerning the sentient and inanimate entities - the one to be attained and the other to be rejected , they jourey along the path described by the terms 'beginning with light and do not return to Samsara'. On account of the passage, 'He leads them to the Brahman' (Ibid., 4.15.5), which holds that the Brahman is attained by both the knower of real nature of the self and the devotees of the Supreme Person and also because of the axiom of 'results according to efforts' (Tat-kratu-nyaya), the entity self, separated from the inanimate matter, should be constantly meditated upon as having its sole joy in absolute subservience to the Supreme Brahman who is Its self. The self's nature of finding only joy consists in absolute subservience to the Surpeme Person. This is proved from the Srutis like 'He who dwells within the self ৷৷. whose body is the self' (Sa. Bra., 14.6.5.5.30)."

Or fire and light are the well-known Vedic deities. As the expression 'mango grove' is used with regard to a place where mango trees are more numerous, similarly, the expressions 'at which time' and 'that time' (in the earlier verse) are used in view of the predominance (of the deities presiding over time). [If the first two (fire and light) are taken as Vedic deities, then the remaining three are the only deities of time. Still, the latter being numerically greater, all the five deities are referred to as deities of time. The deities of both the Paths-of gods and manes, or of the Northern and the Southern Paths as they are called-who are gods of time, are referred to here as 'time' by such words as day, fortnight, six months, etc.] So also, ahah, daytime, means the deity of daytime. Suklah, the bright fortnight, implies the deity presiding over the bright fortnight. Sanmasah uttarayanam, the six months of the Northern solstice-here, too, is understood the deity presiding over the Path. This is the principle (of interpretation followed elsewhere (in the Upanisads also). Tatra, following this Path; janah, persons; who are brahma-vidah, knowers of Brahman, those engaged in meditation on (the alified) Brahman; gacchanti, attain; brahma, Brahman; prayatah, when they die. It is understood that they attain Brahman through stages. Indeed, according to the Upanisadic text, 'His vital forces do not depart' (Br. 4.4.46), there is neither going nor coming back for those established in full realization, who are fit for immediate Liberation. Having their organs merged in Brahman, they are suffused with Brahman, they are verily identified with Brahman."

In the same Brahmana it is taught that their existence and control are dependent on Him, as they are subject to His control and as they constitute His body: 'He whose body is the earth ৷৷. who controls the earth from within' (Br. U., 3.7.3) and 'He whose body is the self ৷৷. He who controls the self from within' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). So also His primacy over everything is taught.

Thus there is the Vedic text, 'The one divine Being is hidden in all beings; He is amnipresent, the indwelling Self of all bengs, the Supervisor of actions, the refuge of all beings, the witness, the one who imparts consceiousness, unconditioned [This is according to Sankaracarya's commentary on this verse. A.G. interprets kevala as non-dual.-Tr.] and without alities' (Sv. 6.11). Anena hetuna, owing to this reason-because of this presiding over; O son of Kunti, the jagat, world, with the moving and the non-moving things, consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest; viparivartate, revolves, under all conditions [During creation, continuance and dissolution.] All the activities of the world in the form, 'I eat this; I see; I hear this; I experience this happiness, suffer this sorrow; I shall do this for that purpose, [Ast. omits this portion.-Tr] I shall do this for this purpose; I shall know this,' etc. indeed arise owing to their being the objects of the conscious witness. They verily exist in consciousness, and end in consciousness. And such mantras as, 'He who is the witness of this is in the supreme heaven' [Supreme heaven, the heart; i.e. He is inscrutable.] (Rg., Na. Su. 10.129.7; Tai. Br.2.8.9), reveal this fact. Since it follows from this that there is no other conscious being part from the one Deity-who is the witness of all as the absolute Consciousness, and who in reality has no contact with any kind of enjoyment-, therefore there is no other enjoyer. Hence, in this context, the estion, 'For what purpose is this creation?', and its answer are baseless-in accordance with the Vedic text, 'Who know (It) truly, who can fully speak about this here? From where has this come? From where is this variegated creation?' (Rg. 3.54.5; 10.129.6). And it has been pointed out by the Lord also: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. Thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15)."

An example is 'Wherein (i.e., in the Supreme Self) the sacrifices known as the Caturhotri attain their fulfilment through the divinities' (Tai. Ar., 4) etc. These texts say in what way these forms of worship apply to these divinties. For all Vedanta texts lay down that the Supreme Person alone is to be worshipped directly when they enjoin the worship of Indra and other divinities, as they form the body of the Supreme Person. The meaning is that in the Caturhotri sacrifice like Agnihotra, the full moon and the new moon sacrifices etc., it is the Supreme Self only that is worshipped, as He abides as the self in Indra etc., who are the ostensible objects worshipped in these sacrifices by which these worshippers obtain their fulfilment through them. Therefore, the votaries of the three Vedas do not understand that these rituals form the worship of the Supreme Person and that He alone is to be worshipped.

Those who intend to worship gods, like Indra and others with the resolution, 'Let us worship Indra and other gods by ceremonies like the new moon and full moon sacrifices' - such worshippers go to Indra and other gods. Those who intend worshipping manes, resolving 'Let us worship the manes through sacrifices,' - such worshippers go to the manes or others resolving - 'Let us worship the Yaksas, Raksasas,' Pisacas and other evil spirits' - they go to them. But those who, with the same rites of worship, worship Me with the intention, 'Let us worship Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Self, whose body is constituted of gods, the manes and the evil spirits' - they are My worshippers and they reach Me only. Those who intend worshipping gods etc., attain gods etc. After sharing limited enjoyment with them, they are destroyed with them when the time comes for their destruction. But My worshippers attain Me, who has no beginning or end, who is omniscient, whose will is unfailingly effective, who is a great ocean of innumerable auspicious attributes of unlimited excellence and whose bliss too is of limitless excellence. They do not return to Samsara. Such is the meaning. Sri Krsna continues to say, 'There is also another distinguishing characteristic of My worshippers.'"

Such an offering coming from a heart rendered pure with that singleness of purpose of considering the offering as an end in itself - I, the Lord of the universe, whose sport consists in the origin, maintenance and dissolution of the entire world, who has all desires fulfilled, whose will is always accomplished, whose auspicious attributes are unlimited and unsurpassed, who is enjoying the infinite and unsurpassed bliss that is in Myself - I accept and enjoy the aforesaid type of offering, as if I was obtaining a desired object far beyond the range of My hopes. Thus it is declared in the Moksa-dharma: \"Whatever acts are consecrated by those whose intellects are concentrated in single-pointed devotion, all these, the Lord Himself accepts on His head.\" (Ma. Bha. Sa., 340.64) Sri Krsna proceeds to say: As there is this distinctive excellence, incomprehensible by speech and mind in respect of these great men called the Jnanins, you also, following them, become a Jnanin, i.e., have your self and all your belongings 'bent down,' i.e., dedicated, under the weight of Bhakti as prescribed earlier. Be always singing My praises, doing My services, worshipping Me and prostrating before Me; also perform your secular and Vedic duties, periodical and occasional, in this manner.'"

      "English": "9.34 Focus your mind on Me; fix your mind on Me uninterruptedly like a continous stream of oil - on Me the Ruler of rulers, antagonistic to all that is evil, the sole abode of auspiciousness, omniscient, whose resolve is always true, the sole cause of the entire universe, the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Person; on Me, of long large eyes like a lotus petal; who has the complexion of a clear blue cloud; whose shining lustre is like that of a thousand suns simultaneously risen; on Me, the great ocean of the nectar of beauty; of four arms, noble and strong, and of brilliant yellow raiment; on Me, adorned with a pure crown, fish-shaped ear-rings, garlands, bracelet on the arms and bangles at the wrist; on Me, the ocean of infinite mercy, affability, beauty, sweetness, majesty, magnanimity and parental affection; on Me, the refuge of all without exception and without regard to their differences; on Me the Lord of all. Sri Krsna again makes the same clear. Be My devotee. Be one whose mind is focussed on Me by contemplating on Me as exceedingly dear. Such is the meaning. He makes thie yet clearer. Be My worshipper, namely, become engaged in My worship, which you have begun to practise by your experience of Me as supremely dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. What is called worship is the conduct of one who realises that he is absolutely a subsidiary - (Sesa) of God. Worship consists also in offering all things of enjoyment such as waving of lights etc., all those things which come into bodily contact like garlands, sandal paste etc., and those meant for offering like food preparations and other edibles. The meaning is this: Let your mind be focussed on Me so as to be engaged in My worship, resulting from love which is unlimited and unsurpassed and which is born from the experience of Myself. Again Sri Krsna expounds the same: Bow down to Me. Do not be satisfied only with services of one who is absolutely subsidiary to me. Do services which are incomparably dear and animated by an experience of Myself who is dear and unlimited and unsurpassed. Also bow down to Me in utter humility, regarding Me as the supreme goal, i.e., He who is the supreme abode and the supreme goal. The meaning is that having resorted to Me, it is impossible for you to live without Me. Having disciplined the mind in this way and considering Me as the supreme goal, you will thus, through love which is unsurpassed and incomparable, obtain a mind which is fit for experiencing Me. You will then reach Me alone. Here the term Atman stands for the mind. The import is that, holding Me as the sole support, possesing a mind of this kind, meditating on Me, experiencing Me, worshipping Me and bowing down to Me - you will reach Me alone. Thus, with such a turn of mind you carry on, for pleasing Me alone, your secular works for bodily sustenance and Vedic activities like obligatory and occasional rites, regarding them as actuated by Me and finding sole joy in absolute subservience to Me. You shall ever engage yourself in praising My names with love and in endeavouring to serve Me and bowing down to Me etc. You shall contemplate on the entire universe as being under My rule and being subsidiary (Sesa) to Me. Contemplating on the multitudes of My attributes, which are exceedingly dear to you, and practising every day this worship as described, you will reach Me alone.  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda 9.34 Manmana bhava, have your mind fixed on Me; [Here Ast. adds the word vasudeva.-Tr] and also be madbhakah, devoted to Me. Madyaji, sacrifice to Me, be engaged in sacrificing to Me. And namaskuru, bow down; only mam, to Me. Yuktva, by concentrating your mind; and mat-parayanah, by accepting Me as the supreme Goal; esyasi eva, you shall surely attain; mam, Me who am God. You shall attain Me evam atmanam, who am thus the Self: I indeed am the Self of all the beings, and am also the supreme Goal. You shall attain Me who am such. In this way, the word atmanam (Self) is to be connected with the preceding word mam (Me). This is the purport."

      "English": "10.3 He who exists 'without being born' at any particular time unlike other beings is 'unborn' in the sense of being eternal. For, this attribute denotes a unie state distinct in kind both from insentient things which are subject to modifications, and from the self in Its state of involvement in Samsara when It is united with insentient matter. In that state the birth of the self involved in matter is generated by Karma. The temr 'Anadi', or without beginning, is used to distinguish the state of the Lord, which is distinct in kind, from that of the liberated state which is birthless but can be said to have a beginning. For, to the liberated self, the state of liberation has a beginning, because, in regard to this, conjunction with matter which deserves to be abandoned, existed previously. Hence the term 'Anadi' implies that the Lord is without such conjunction and does not deserve the same description. The Sruti also says: 'Him who is stainless' (Sve. U., 4.19). Thus, he who is undeluded among the mortals understands Me as 'the great Lord of the worlds,' as the Lord of the lords of the worlds. My nature is incompatible with association with evil which has to be given up. What is called 'delusion' is the wrong knowledge of taking Me as one among other entities of the same kind. To be bereft of this delusion is to be 'undeluded'. Such a person is released from all sins which stand against the rise of Bhakti to Me. The meaning is this: In this world, the king who rules over men is only like all those men. He has become a ruler by some good Karma. Such is not the case with the Lord of the gods (the Supreme Being). Even the lord of the cosmic egg (Brahma) is of the same class as other beings in Samsara, because he too is a created being coming within the threefold classification of beings according to the three innate tendencies for growth - namely Karma-bhavana, Brahma-bhavana and Ubhaya-bhavana. These three are described respectively as fitness to practise work alone, fitness to practise meditation alone and fitness to practise both together. Brahma comes under the third group. The Sruti also says, 'He who creates Brahma' (Sve. U., 6.18). The same is the case with all those who have acired the eight superhuman powers like becoming atomic etc. But I, the Supreme Being, is the great Lord of the worlds. He who is not subject to the delusion of regarding Me as of the same order as others, - such a person knows Me as distinct in kind from non-conscient matter in its states as cause and effect, from the self whether bound or free, and from everything else, on account of all of them being subject to My control. I am antagonistic to all that is evil and I am the sole centre of innumerable auspicious attributes, unsurpassed and incomparable. It is also My inherent nature to be the controller of everything. One who understands Me to be all this is released from every sin. Thus, after showing the annihilation, by meditation on His nature, of all evil impeding the rise of Bhakti, and also of the rise of devotion, through implication, by the destruction of such opposing factors, Sri Krsna now explains the way in which Bhakti develops by meditation on His sovereign power and on the multitude of His auspicious attributes:"

'Cheerfulness' is the natural disposition to feel pleased with everything seen. 'Austerity' is the chastising of the body by denying to oneself pleasures, as enjoined by the scriptures. 'Beneficence' is giving to another what contributes to one's own enjoyment. 'Fame' is the renown of possessing good alities. 'Infamy' is notoriety of possessing bad alities. The workings of the mind which are in accordance with fame and infamy must be understood here, because it is the subject-matter of the context. Austerity and beneficence are to be understood in the same way. All these mental faculties - these functioning of the mind - resulting either in activity or inactivity, are from Me alone, i.e., are dependent on My volition. Sri Krsna declares: 'Thos agents who direct the creation, sustentation etc., of all beings, have their activity dependent on My Will.'"

Thus the Srutis assert: 'From whom all these beings are born, by whom, when born, they live and unto whom they go when they perish - desire to know that well. This is Brahman' (Tai. U., 3.1.1); 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Ibid., 2.1.1); and 'He who knows the Supreme Brahman becomes the Brahman' (Mun. U., 3.2.9). Likewise He is the Supreme Light. The term 'Dhaman' connotes light. He is the Supreme Light as taught (in the Upanisads): 'Now, the light which shines higher than this heaven ৷৷.' (Cha. U., 3.13. 7); 'Attaining the Supreme Light. He appears with His own form' (Ibid., 8.12.2); 'The gods worship Him as the Light of lights' (Br. U., 4.4.16). So also He is the Supreme Sanctifier: He makes the meditator bereft of all the impurities, and also destroyes them without any trace. The Srutis declares: 'As water clings not to the leaf of a lotus-flower, so evil deeds cling not to him who knows thus' (Cha. U., 4.14.3): 'Just as the fibre of Isika reed (reed-cotton) laid on a fire is burnt up, so also all his sins are burnt up' (Ibid., 5.24.3); and 'Narayana is Supreme Brahman, Narayana is Supreme Light, Narayana is Supreme Self' (Ma. Na., 9.4). Sages are those who know in reality the higher truth (the Supreme Brahman), and the lower truth (individual selves); they speak of You as the eternal Divine Person, Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa declare: 'This Narayana, Lord of Sri, the resident of the Milk Ocean, has come to the city of Mathura abandoning his Serpent-couch.' 'Where Madhusudana is, there is the blessed Dvaravati. He is the Lord Himself, the ancient One and Eternal Dharma (Ma. Bh. Vana. 88. 24-25). Those who know the Vedas and those who know the self declare the great-minded Krsna to be the eternal Dharma. Of all sanctifiers, Govinda is said to be the most sanctifying, the most auspicious among the auspicious. The lotus-eyed God of gods, the eternal, abides as the three worlds ৷৷. Hari who is beyond thought, abides thus. Madhusudana is there alone' (Ma. Bha. Vana., 88.24-28). Similarly it is stated: 'O Arjuna, where the divine, the eternal Narayana the Supreme Self is, there the entire universe, the sacred water and the holy shrines are to be found. That is sacred, that is Supreme Brahman, that is sacred waters, that is the austerity grove ৷৷. there dwell the divine sages, the Siddhas and all those rich in austerities where the Primal Lord, the agent Yogin Madhusudana dwells. It is the most sacred among the sacred. For you, let there be no doubt about this' (Ibid., 90.28-32); 'Krsna Himself is the origin and dissolution of all beings. For, this universe, consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, was generated for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha. Sabha., 38.23). And you yourself say so in the passage beginning with 'Earth, water, fire, ether, mind, intellect and Ahankara - this Prakrti, which is divided eightfold, is Mine' (7.4) and ending with 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8)."

      "English": "10.12 - 10.13 Arjuna said You are He whom the Srutis proclaim as the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light, the Supreme Sanctifier. Thus the Srutis assert: 'From whom all these beings are born, by whom, when born, they live and unto whom they go when they perish - desire to know that well. This is Brahman' (Tai. U., 3.1.1); 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Ibid., 2.1.1); and 'He who knows the Supreme Brahman becomes the Brahman' (Mun. U., 3.2.9). Likewise He is the Supreme Light. The term 'Dhaman' connotes light. He is the Supreme Light as taught (in the Upanisads): 'Now, the light which shines higher than this heaven ৷৷.' (Cha. U., 3.13. 7); 'Attaining the Supreme Light. He appears with His own form' (Ibid., 8.12.2); 'The gods worship Him as the Light of lights' (Br. U., 4.4.16). So also He is the Supreme Sanctifier: He makes the meditator bereft of all the impurities, and also destroyes them without any trace. The Srutis declares: 'As water clings not to the leaf of a lotus-flower, so evil deeds cling not to him who knows thus' (Cha. U., 4.14.3): 'Just as the fibre of Isika reed (reed-cotton) laid on a fire is burnt up, so also all his sins are burnt up' (Ibid., 5.24.3); and 'Narayana is Supreme Brahman, Narayana is Supreme Light, Narayana is Supreme Self' (Ma. Na., 9.4). Sages are those who know in reality the higher truth (the Supreme Brahman), and the lower truth (individual selves); they speak of You as the eternal Divine Person, Primal Lord, the unborn and all-pervading. So also divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa declare: 'This Narayana, Lord of Sri, the resident of the Milk Ocean, has come to the city of Mathura abandoning his Serpent-couch.' 'Where Madhusudana is, there is the blessed Dvaravati. He is the Lord Himself, the ancient One and Eternal Dharma (Ma. Bh. Vana. 88. 24-25). Those who know the Vedas and those who know the self declare the great-minded Krsna to be the eternal Dharma. Of all sanctifiers, Govinda is said to be the most sanctifying, the most auspicious among the auspicious. The lotus-eyed God of gods, the eternal, abides as the three worlds ৷৷. Hari who is beyond thought, abides thus. Madhusudana is there alone' (Ma. Bha. Vana., 88.24-28). Similarly it is stated: 'O Arjuna, where the divine, the eternal Narayana the Supreme Self is, there the entire universe, the sacred water and the holy shrines are to be found. That is sacred, that is Supreme Brahman, that is sacred waters, that is the austerity grove ৷৷. there dwell the divine sages, the Siddhas and all those rich in austerities where the Primal Lord, the agent Yogin Madhusudana dwells. It is the most sacred among the sacred. For you, let there be no doubt about this' (Ibid., 90.28-32); 'Krsna Himself is the origin and dissolution of all beings. For, this universe, consisting of sentient and non-sentient entities, was generated for the sake of Krsna' (Ma. Bha. Sabha., 38.23). And you yourself say so in the passage beginning with 'Earth, water, fire, ether, mind, intellect and Ahankara - this Prakrti, which is divided eightfold, is Mine' (7.4) and ending with 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8).  English Translation Of Sri Shankaracharya's Sanskrit Commentary By Swami Gambirananda 10.13 Bhavan, You; are the param brahma, supreme Brahman, the supreme Self; the param dhama, supreme Light; the paramam pavitram, supreme Sanctifier.

And even Vyasa also speaks in this very way. Ca, and; svayam, You Yourself; eva, verily; bravisi, tell; me, me (so)."

Similarly it has been stated there that 'being the creator etc.,' is meant by the term Yoga, and that their 'being actuated,' meant by the term Vibhuti. Again it is stated: 'I am the origin of all; from me proceed everything; thinking thus, the wise worship Me with all devotion' (10.8). Sri Krsna clearly declares that he rules over all creatures by actuating them from within as their Self.

      "English": "10.20 I am the Self dwelling in the heart of all beings who constitute My body. What is called 'Self' is in every way the supporter, controller and the principal of a body. It is further declared: 'And I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge and their removal' (15.15), and 'The Lord dwells, O Arjuna in the heart of every being causing them to spin round and round by His power, as if set on a wheel' (18.61). The Srutis also declare: 'He who, dwelling in all beings, is within all beings, whom all beings do not know, whose body all beings are, who controls all beings from within, is your Inner Controller, immortal Self (Br. U., 3.7.15); and 'He who, dwelling in the self is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, and who controls the self from within, He is your Inner Controller and Immortal Self' (Sata. Br., 14.5.30). Thus, I am the Self of all beings and I am their beginning, the middle and also the end. The meaning is that I am the cause of their origination, sustentation and dissolution. Thus, having explained that the Lord's immanence in all beings, which are His manifestations having Him, as their Self, is the ground for naming them in the manner of Samanadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication with Him (i.e., predication that they are He Himself), Sri Krsna proceeds to present some specific or distinguished manifestations in the same style of co-ordinate predication. As the Lord abides as the Self in all, the final significance of all terms culminates in Him. Terms such as god, man, bird, tree etc., though they signify the respective physical forms of those objects, they culminate through them in the selves in them as their final significance. Just like that here it is going to be stated in the conclusion of the account of the manifestations of the Lord, that the Lord's immanence in them all as their Self is the basis for describing them in such co-ordinate predication (as He Himself). The text 'There is nothing, moving or unmoving, apart from Me' (10.39) says that they are inseparable from Him, and this inseparability is the result of their being under His control. This has been initially declared in the words 'All proceed from Me' (10.8). [This word Samanadhikaranya is translated by some also as 'grammatical co-ordination.' It is a context in which a number of words, usually having varying denotations, are used to signify an identical object. This kind of co-ordinate relation occurs in all the following verses in which Sri Krsna eates Himself with various objects having different denotations as Atman, Visnu among the Adityas, Indra, Marici, Sankara, Kubera, etc. Further explanation is given in the commentary.]"

Your mouth is emitting fire, namely, the fire appropriate for destroying all things, as the Fire of Time consumes the world at the time of dissolution.

How, in one divine body, can there be many stomachs etc.? This is possible in the following way: From a hip of infinite extent, stomachs etc., as described, branc off upwards. The divine feet etc., branch off downwards. So there is no contradiction in attributing a pair of eyes for each face.

It expresses the idea that it is the foundation of all - of the principle of the Prakrti with its conditions, and of the individual selves in all states. It has also been initially declared: 'For by You alone are pervaded the interspace of heaven and earth ৷৷.' (11.20). 'Beholding Your form shining, multicoloured, and with yawning mouths and large and resplendent eyes, my inner being trembles in fear. I am unable to find support, namely, I am unable to find support for the body. I am unable to get peace of mind and of the senses.

O Infinite, O Lord of the gods, O You who have the universe for Your abode! You are the 'Aksara'. What does not perish, is the Aksara, here, the 'principle of individual self'; for the individual self does not perish as established in Sruti passages: 'The intelligent self is not born, nor dies' (Ka. U., 1.2.18). You alone are the 'existent and the non-existent,' the principle of Prakrti, in its condition as effect and in its condition as cause. This is denoted by the terms 'Sat' (existent) and 'Asat' (non-existent). You alone are the state of effect denoted by the term 'Sat', which is the state of diversification by names and forms, and also the state of cause, denoted by the tetm 'Asat', which is the state incapable of such divisions and diversities. 'What is beyond both' - what is beyond Prakrti and the individual self associated with the Prakrti, as also from the principle of liberated selves who are different from those associated with Prakrti, i.e., bound souls. You alone are that also. Therefore:"

Upasana, meditation, means approaching an object of meditation as presented by the scriptures, and making it an object of one's own thought and dwelling on it uniterruptedly for long by continuing the same current of thought with regard to it-like a line of pouring oil. This is what is called upasana. The Lord states the characteristics of the Immutable [Here Ast. adds 'upasyasya, which is the object of meditation'.-Tr.] : Sarvatragam, all-pervading, pervasive like space; and acintyam, incomprehensible-becuase of Its being unmanifest. For, whatever comes within the range of the organs can be thought of by the mind also. Being opposed to that, the Immutable is inconceivable. It is kutastham, changeless. Kuta means something apparently good, but evil inside. The word kuta (deceptive) is well known in the world in such phrases as, 'kuta-rupam, deceptive in appearance,' 'kuta-saksyam, false evidence', etc. Thus, kuta is that which, as ignorance etc., is the seed of many births, full of evil within, referred to by such words as maya, the undifferentiated, etc., and well known from such texts as, 'One should know Maya to be Nature, but the Lord of Maya to be the supreme God' (Sv. 4.10), 'The divine Maya of Mine is difficult to cross over' (7.14), etc. That which exists on that kuta as its controller (or witness) is the kuta-stha. Or, kutastha may mean that which exists like a heap [That is, motionless.]. Hence it is acalam, immovable. Since It is immovable, therefore It is dhruvam, constant, i.e. eternal."

      "English": "12.3 - 12.5 The individual self meditated upon by those who follow the path of the 'Aksara' (the Imperishable) is thus described: It cannot be 'defined' in terms indicated by expressions like gods and men etc., for It is different from the body; It is 'imperceptible' through the senses such as eyes; It is 'omnipresent and unthinkable,' for though It exists everywhere in bodies such as those of gods and others, It cannot be conceived in terms of those bodies, as It is an entity of an altogether different kind; It is 'common to all beings' i.e., alike in all beings but different from the bodily forms distinguishing them; It is 'immovable' as It does not move out of Its unie nature, being unmodifiable, and therefore eternal. Such aspirants are further described as those who, 'subduing their senses' like the eye from their natural operations, look upon all beings of different forms as 'eal' by virtue of their knowledge of the sameness of the nature of the selves as knowers in all. Therefore they are not given 'to take pleasure in the misfortune of others,' as such feelings proceed from one's identification with one's own special bodily form. Those who meditate on the Imperishable Principle (individual self) in this way, even they come to Me. It means that they also realise their essential self, which, in respect of freedom from Samsara, is like My own Self. So Sri Krsna will declare later on: 'Partaking of My nature' (14.2). Also the Sruti says: 'Untainted, he attains supreme eality' (Mun. U., 3.1.3). Likewise He will declare the Supreme Brahman as being distinct from the freed self which is without modification and is denoted by the term 'Imperishable' (Aksara), and is described as unchanging (Kutastha). 'The Highest Person is other than this Imperishable' (15.16 - 17). But in the teaching in Aksara-vidya 'Now that higher science by which that Aksara is known' (Mun. U., 1.5) the entity that is designated by the term Aksara is Supreme Brahman Himself; for He is the source of all beings, etc. Greater is the difficulty of those whose minds are attached to the unmanifest. The path of the unmanifest is a psychosis of the mind with the unmanifest as its object. It is accomplished with difficulty by embodied beings, who have misconceived the body as the self. For, embodied beings mistake the body for the self. The superiority of those who adore the Supreme Being is now stated clearly:"

'One with a controlled mind' means one with the mind subdued. When the individual self is visualised to be of the nature of a Sesa (subsidiary) to the Lord, and when the veil of nescience consisting in identifying the self with the body is removed by contemplation on the self generated through the performance of works without attachment to the fruits and with My propitiation as the sole objective - then supreme Bhakti to Me will originate by itself. [The point driven home is this: It is nescience that stands between the Jiva and the Lord. This nescience consists in identification of the self with the body. It is through works done without an eye on their fruits but exclusively as an offering to the Lord, that this nescience is removed. Thus Karma Yoga is the sprout of self-realisation, and of Bhakti. On the nescience being removed, the knowledge that one (i.e., the Jiva) is a Sesa (an absolutely dependent liege) of the Lord, dawns on the Jiva. Such knowledge generates exclusive devotion or Bhakti accompanied by Prapatti. Or if the Jiva gets immersed in Its own bliss, It will attain Kaivalya.] In the same manner, Sri Krsna will further show in the text beginning with 'By worshipping Him with his work will a man reach perfection' (18.46) and ending with 'Forsaking the feeling of \"I\" and with no feeling of \"mine\" and tranil, one becomes worthy of the state of Brahman. Having realised the state of Brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves. Regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me' (18.53-54)."

      "English": "12.12 Jnanam, knowledge; [Firm conviction about the Self arrived at through Vedic texts and reasoning.] is hi, surely; sreyah, superior; -to what?-abhyasat, to practice [Practice-repeated effort to ascertain the true meaning of Vedic texts, in order to acire knowledge.] which is not preceded by discrimination. Dhyanam, meditation, undertaken along with knowledge; visisyate, surpasses even jnanat, that knowledge. Karma-phala-tyagah, renunciation of the results of works; excels even dhyanat, meditation associated with knowledge. ('Excels' has to be supplied.) Tyagat, from this renunciation of the results of actions, in the way described before; [By dedicating all actions to God with the idea, 'May God be pleased.'] santih, Peace, the cessation of transmigratory existence together with its cause; follows anantaram, immediately; not that it awaits another accasion. Should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoined earlier, then, for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to Liberation. But this has not been done at the very beginning. And for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in, 'Knowledge is surely superior to practice,' etc. by teaching about the successive excellence. For it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented [Presented from verse 3 onwards.] Objection: From what similarly does the eulogy follow? Reply: In the verse, 'When all desires clinging to one's heart fall off' (Ka, 2.3.14), it has been stated that Immortality results from the rejection of all desires. That is well known. And 'all desires' means the 'result of all rites and duties enjoined in the Vedas and Smrtis'. From the renunciation of these, Peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in Knowledge. There is a similarity between renunciation of all desires and renunciation of the results of actions by an unenlightened person. Hence, on account of that similarity this eulogy of renunciation of the results of all actions is meant for rousing interest. As for instance, by saying that the sea was drunk up by the Brahmana Agastya, the Brahmanas of the present day are also praised owing to the similarity of Brahminhood. In this way it was been said that Karma-yoga becomes a means for Liberation,since it involves renunciaton of the rewards of works. Here, again, the Yoga consisting in the concentration of mind on God as the Cosmic Person, as also the performance of actions etc. for God, have been spoken of by assuming a difference between God and Self. In, 'If you are unable to do even this' (11) since it has been hinted that it (Karma-yoga) is an effect of ignorance, therefore the Lord is pointing out that Karma-yoga is not suitable for the meditator on the Immutable, who is aware of idenity (of the Self with God). The Lord is similarly pointing out the impossibility of a karma-yogin's meditation on the Immutable. In (the verse), 'they৷৷.attain Me alone' (4), having declared that those who meditate on the Immutable are independent so far as the attainment of Liberation is concerned, the Lord has shown in, '৷৷.I become the Deliverer' (7), that others have no independence; they are dependent on God. For, if they (the former) be considered to have become identified with God, they would be the same as the Immutable on account of (their) having realized non-difference. Conseently, speaking of them as objects of the act of deliverance will become inappropriate! And, since the Lord in surely the greatest well-wisher of Arjuna, He imparts instructions only about Karma-yoga, which involves perception of duality and is not associated with full Illumination. Also, no one who has realized his Self as God through valid means of knowledge would like subordination to another, since it involves a contradiction. Therefore, with the idea, 'I shall speak of the group of virtues (as stated in), \"He hwo is not hateful towards any creature,\" etc. which are the direct means to Immortality, to those monks who meditate on the Immutable,who are steadfast in full enlightenment and have given up all desires,' the Lord proceeds:"

      "English": "12.12 More than the practice of remembrance (of the Lord), which is difficult in the absence of love for the Lord, the direct knowledge of the self, arising from the contemplation of the imperishable self (Aksara), is conducive to the well-being of the self. Better than the imperfect knowledge of the self, is perfect meditation on the self, as it is more conducive to the well-being of the self. More conducive than imperfect meditation (i.e., meditation unaccompanied with renunciation), is the activity performed with renunciation of the fruits. It is only after the annihilation of sins, through the performance of works accompanied by renounciation of fruits, that peace of mind is attained. When the mind is at peace, perfect meditation on the self is possible. From meditation results the direct realisation of the self. From the direct realisation of the self results supreme devotion. It is in this way that Atmanistha or devotion to the individual self becomes useful for a person who is incapable of practising loving devotion to the Supreme Being. And for one practising the discipline for attaining the self (Jnana Yoga) without acisition of perfect tranillity of mind, disinterested activity (Karma Yoga), including in it meditation on the self, is the better path for the knowledge of the self. [Thus the steps are performance of works without desire for fruits, eanimity of mind, meditation on the self, self-realisation, and devotion to the Lord.] Now Sri Krsna enumerates the attributes reired of one intent on performance of disinterested activity:"

      "English": "The body which is cognised in identity with the experiencing self by co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) in the propositions, 'I am a god, 'I am a man,' 'I am fat,' 'I am slender' etc., is described by those who know the real nature of the body as only the Field (Ksetra) of experience for the experiencing self, who is distinct from the body. Those who know this, namely, those who know the exact nature of the self, call It the Field-knower (Ksetrajna). That knower who knows the body, as divided into its different members and as their collectivity, can say 'I know it, the body, as an object.' The person with this perception is the one who is called the Ksetrajna or the Field-knower, who must necessarily be different from the Field (Ksetra), which is the object of this knowledge. It is true that at the time of perceiving an object like a pot which is different from one's body, the seer who thinks 'I am a god who sees it' or 'I am a man who sees it' etc., is putting himself as identical with the body through co-ordinate predication. In the same way he experiences the body as an object of knowledge when he says 'I know this body.' Thus if the body is an object of knowledge, it must be different from the knowing self. Therefore, the Field-knower (Ksetrajna). The knower, is other than the body which is an object of knowledge like a jar, etc. But this knowledge which arises by way of co-ordinate predication is justified on the ground that the body is inseparable from oneself; for it constitutes an attribute of the self like 'cow-ness' of the cow etc. The knowing self is however unie in being an eternal and subtle form of knowledge. But this is inaccessible to the ordinary man's organs of vision; it is accessible only to a mind refined by Yoga. The ignorant see the knower only in the form of Prakrti because of close proximity to or union with Prakrti. Sri Krsna thus declares later on: 'When in identiciation with the Gunas he departs or stays or experiences, the deluded perceive him not. They, who have the eye of knowledge, see' (15.10)."

उसको समस्त उपाधिभेदसे रहित एवं सत् और असत् आदि शब्दप्रतीतिसे जाननेमें न आनेवाला ही समझ। हे भारत जब कि क्षेत्र? क्षेत्रज्ञ और ईश्वरइनके यथार्थ स्वरूपसे अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई ज्ञानका विषय शेष नहीं रहता? इसलिये ज्ञेयस्वरूप क्षेत्र और क्षेत्रज्ञका जो ज्ञान है -- जिस ज्ञानसे क्षेत्र और क्षेत्रज्ञ प्रत्यक्ष किये,जाते हैं? वही ज्ञान यथार्थ ज्ञान है। मुझ ईश्वर -- विष्णुका यही मत -- अभिप्राय है। पू0 -- यदि समस्त शरीरोंमें एक ही ईश्वर है? उससे अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई भोक्ता नहीं है? ऐसा मानें? तो ईश्वरको संसारी मानना हुआ नहीं तो ईश्वरसे अतिरिक्त अन्य संसारीका अभाव होनेसे संसारके अभावका प्रसङ्ग आ जाता है। यह दोनों ही अनिष्ट हैं क्योंकि ऐसा मान लेनेपर बन्ध? मोक्ष और उनके कारणका प्रतिपादन करनेवाले शास्त्र व्यर्थ हो जाते हैं और प्रत्यक्षादि प्रमाणोंसे भी इस मान्यताका विरोध है। प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाणसे तो सुखदुःख और उनका कारणरूप यह संसार दीख ही रहा है। इसके सिवा जगत्की विचित्रताको देखकर पुण्यपापहेतुक संसारका होना अनुमानसे भी सिद्ध होता है? परंतु आत्मा और ईश्वरकी एकता मान लेनेपर ये सबकेसब अयुक्त ठहरते हैं। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि ज्ञान और अज्ञानका भेद होनेसे यह सब सम्भव है। ( श्रुतिमें भी कहा है कि ) प्रसिद्ध जो अविद्या और विद्या हैं वे अत्यन्त विपरीत और भिन्न समझी गयी हैं तथा ( उसी जगह ) उन विद्या और अविद्याका फल भी श्रेय और प्रेय इस प्रकार परस्परविरुद्ध दिखलाया गया है? इनमें विद्याका फल श्रेय ( मोक्ष ) और अविद्याका प्रेय ( इष्ट भोगोंकी प्राप्ति ) है। वैसे ही श्रीव्यासजीने भी कहा है कि यह दोनों ही मार्ग है इत्यादि तथा यह दो ही मार्ग हैं इत्यादि और यहाँ गीताशास्त्रमें भी दो निष्ठाएँ बतलायी गयी हैं। इसके सिवा श्रुति? स्मृति और न्यायसे भी यही सिद्ध होता है कि विद्याके द्वारा कार्यसहित अविद्याका नाश करना चाहिये। इस विषयमें ये श्रुतियाँ यहाँ यदि जान लिया तो बहुत ठीक है और यदि यहाँ नहीं जाना तो बड़ी भारी हानि है उसको इस प्रकार जाननेवाला यहाँ अमृत हो जाता है परमपदकी प्राप्तिके लिये ( विद्याके सिवा ) अन्य मार्ग नहीं है विद्वान् किसीसे भी भयभीत नहीं होता। किन्तु अज्ञानीके विषयमें ( कहा है कि ) उसको भय होता है जो कि अविद्याके बीचमें ही प़ड़े हुए हैं जो ब्रह्मको जानता है वह ब्रह्म ही हो जाता है यह देव अन्य है और मैं अन्य हूँ इस प्रकार जो समझता है वह आत्मतत्त्वको नहीं जानता जैसे ( मनुष्योंका पशु होता है वैसे ही वह देवताओंका पशु है किन्तु जो आत्मज्ञानी है ( उसविषयमें ) वह यह सब कुछ हो जाता है यदि आकाशको चमक समान लपेटा जा सके इत्यादि सहस्रों श्रुतियाँ हैं। तथा ये स्मृतियाँ भी हैं -- ज्ञान अज्ञानसे ढका हुआ है? इसलिये जीव मोहित हो रहे हैं जिनका चित्त समतामें स्थित है उन्होंने यहीं संसारको जीत लिया है सर्वत्र समानभावसे देखता हुआ इत्यादि। युक्तिसे भी यह बात सिद्ध है। जैसे कहा है कि सर्प? कुशकंण्टक और तालाबको जान लेनेपर मनुष्य उनसे बच जाते हैं? किन्तु बिना जाने कई एक उनमें गिर जाते हैं? इस न्यायसे ज्ञानका जो विशेष फल है उसको समझ। इस प्रकार उपर्युक्त प्रमाणोंसे यह ज्ञान होता है कि देहादिमें आत्मबुद्धि करनेवाला अज्ञानी रागद्वेषादि दोषोंसे प्रेरित होकर धर्मअधर्मरूप कर्मोंका अनुष्ठान करता हुआ जन्मता और मरता रहता है? किंतु देहादिसे अतिरिक्त आत्माका साक्षात् करनेवाले पुरुषोंके रागद्वेषादि दोष निवृत्त हो जाते हैं? इससे उनकी धर्माधर्मविषयक प्रवृत्ति शान्त हो जानेसे वे मुक्त हो जाते हैं। इस बातका कोई भी न्यायानुसार विरोध नहीं कर सकता।अतः यह सिद्ध हुआ कि जो वास्तवमें ईश्वर ही है उस क्षेत्रज्ञको अविद्याद्वारा आरोपित उपाधिके भेदसे संसारित्व प्राप्तसा हो जाता है? जैसे कि जीवको देहादिमें आत्मबुद्धि हो जाती है क्योंकि समस्त जीवोंका जो देहादि अनात्मपदार्थोंमें आत्मभाव प्रसिद्ध है? वह निःसंदेह अविद्याकृत ही है। जैसे स्तम्भमें मनुष्यबुद्धि हो जाती है? परंतु इतनेहीसे मनुष्यके धर्म स्तम्भमें और स्तम्भके धर्म मनुष्यमें नहीं आ जाते? वैसे ही चेतनके धर्म देहमें और देहके धर्म चेतनमें नहीं आ सकते। जरा और मृत्युके समान ही अविद्याके कार्य होनेसे सुखदुःख और अज्ञान आदि भी उन्हींकी भाँति आत्माके धर्म नहीं हो सकते। पू0 -- यदि ऐसा मानें कि विषम होनेके कारण यह दृष्टान्त ठीक नहीं है अर्थात् स्तम्भ और पुरुष दोनों ज्ञेय वस्तु हैं? उनमें अविद्यावश ज्ञाताद्वारा एकमें एकका अध्यास किया गया है परंतु देह और आत्मामें तो ज्ञेय और ज्ञाताका ही एक दूसरेमें अध्यास होता है? इसलिये यह दृष्टान्त सम नहीं है? अतः यह सिद्ध होता है कि देहका ज्ञेयरूप ( सुखदुःखादि ) धर्म भी ज्ञाता -- आत्मामें होता है। उ0 -- इसमें आत्माको जड़ मानने आदिका प्रसङ्ग आ जाता है? इसलिये ऐसा मानना ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि यदि ज्ञेयरूप शरीरादि -- क्षेत्रक सुख? दुःख? मोह और इच्छादि धर्म ज्ञाता ( आत्मा ) के भी होते हैं? तो यह बतलाना चाहिये कि ज्ञेयरूप क्षेत्रके अविद्याद्वारा आरोपित कुछ धर्म तो आत्मामें होते हैं और कुछ -- जरामरणादि नहीं होते? इस विशेषताका कारण क्या है बल्कि? ऐसा अनुमान तो किया जा सकता है कि जरा आदिके समान अविद्याद्वारा आरोपित और त्याज्य तथा ग्राह्य होनेके कारण ये सुखदुःखादि ( आत्माके धर्म ) नहीं हैं। ऐसा होनेसे यह सिद्ध हुआ कि कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वरूप यह संसार ज्ञेय वस्तुमें स्थित हुआ ही अविद्याद्वारा ज्ञातामें अध्यारोपित है? अतः उससे ज्ञाताका कुछ भी नहीं बिगड़ता? जैसे कि मूर्खोंद्वारा अध्यारोपित तलमलिनतादिसे आकाशका ( कुछ भी नहीं बिगड़ता )। अतः सब शरीरोंमें रहते हुए भी भगवान्क्षेत्रज्ञ ईश्वरमें संसारीपनके गन्धमात्रकी भी शङ्का नहीं करनी चाहिये क्योंकि संसारमें कहीं भी अविद्याद्वारा आरोपित धर्मसे किसीका भी उपकार या अपकार होता नहीं देखा जाता। तुमने जो यह कहा था कि ( स्तम्भमें मनुष्यके भ्रमका ) दृष्टान्त सम नहीं है सो ( यह कहना ) भूल है। पू0 -- कैसे उ0अविद्याजन्य अध्यासमात्रमें ही दृष्टान्त और दार्ष्टान्तकी समानता विवक्षित है। उसमें कोई दोष नहीं आता। परंतु तुम जो यह मानते हो कि ज्ञातामें दृष्टान्त और दार्ष्टान्तकी विषमताका दोष आता है? तो उसका भी अपवाद? जरामृत्यु आदिके दृष्टान्तसे दिखला दिया गया है। पू0 -- यदि ऐसा कहें कि अविद्यायुक्त होनेसे क्षेत्रज्ञको ही संसारित्व प्राप्त हुआ? तो उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि अविद्या? तामस प्रत्यय है। तामस प्रत्यय? चाहे विपरीत ग्रहण करनेवाला,( विपर्यय ) हो? चाहे संशय उत्पन्न करनेवाला ( संशय ) हो और चाहे कुछ भी ग्रहण न करनेवाला हो? आवरणरूप होनेके कारण वह अविद्या ही है? क्योंकि विवेकरूप प्रकाशके होनेपर वह दूर हो जाता है तथा आवरणरूप तमोमय तिमिरादि दोषोंके रहते हुए ही अग्रहण आदिरूप तीन प्रकारकी अविद्याका अस्तित्व उपलब्ध होता है। पू0 -- यदि यह बात है तब तो अविद्या ज्ञाताका धर्म हुआ उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि तिमिररोगादिजन्य दोष चक्षु आदि करणोंमें ही देखे जाते हैं ( ज्ञाता आत्मामें नहीं )। जो तुम ऐसा मानते हो कि अविद्या ज्ञाताका धर्म है और अविद्यारूप धर्मसे युक्त होना ही उसका संसारित्व है? इसलिये यह कहना ठीक नहीं है कि ईश्वर ही क्षेत्रज्ञ है और वह संसारी नहीं है सो तुम्हारा ऐसा मानना युक्तियुक्त नहीं है क्योंकि नेत्ररूप करणमें विपरीत ग्राहकता आदि दोष देखे जाते हैं तो भी वे विपरीतादि ग्रहण या उनके कारणरूप तिमिरादि दोष ज्ञाताके नहीं हो जाते ( उसी प्रकार देहके धर्म भी आत्माके नहीं हो सकते )। तथा जैसे आँखका संस्कार करके तिमिरादि प्रतिबन्धको हटा देनेपर ग्रहीता पुरुषमें वे दोष नहीं देखे जाते? इसलिये वे ग्रहीता पुरुषके धर्म नहीं हैं? वैसे ही अग्रहण? विपरीतग्रहण और संशय आदि प्रत्यय तथा उनके कारणरूप तिमिरादि दोष भी सर्वत्र किसीनकिसी करणके ही हो सकते हैं -- ज्ञाता पुरुषके अर्थात् क्षेत्रज्ञके नहीं। इसके सिवा वे जाननेमें आनेवाले ( ज्ञानके विषय ) होनेसे भी दीपकके प्रकाशकी भाँति ज्ञाताके धर्म नहीं हो सकते क्योंकि वे ज्ञेय हैं? इसलिये अपनेसे अतिरिक्त किसी अन्यद्वारा जाननेमें आनेवाले हैं। सभी आत्मवादी समस्त करणोंसे आत्माका वियोग होनेके उपरान्त कैवल्य अवस्थामें आत्माको अविद्यादि दोषोंसे रहित मानते हैं? इससे भी ( उपर्युक्त सिद्धान्त ही सिद्ध होता है ) क्योंकि यदि अग्निकी उष्णताके समान ये ( सुखदुःखादि दोष ) क्षेत्रज्ञ आत्माके अपने धर्म हों तो उनसे उसका कभी वियोग नहीं हो सकेगा। इसके सिवा आकाशकी भाँति सर्वव्यापक? मूर्तिरहित? निर्विकार आत्माका किसीके साथ संयोगवियोग होना सम्भव नहीं है? इससे भी क्षेत्रज्ञकी नित्य ईश्वरता ही सिद्ध होती है। तथा अनादित्वान्िनर्गुणत्वात् इत्यादि भगवान्के वचनोंसे भी क्षेत्रज्ञका नित्य ईश्वरत्व हि सिद्ध होता है। पू0 -- ऐसा मान लेनेपर तो संसार और संसारित्वका अभाव हो जानेके कारण शास्त्रकी व्यर्थता आदि दोष उपस्थित होंगे उ0 -- नहीं क्योंकि यह दोष तो सभीने स्वीकार किया है। सभी आत्मवादियोंद्वारा स्वीकार किये हुए दोषका किसी एकके लिये ही परिहार करना आवश्यक नहीं है।  , पू0 -- इसे सबने कैसे स्वीकार किया है उ0 -- सभी आत्मवादियोंने मुक्त आत्मामें संसार और संसारीपनके व्यवहारका अभाव माना है? परंतु ( इससे ) उनके मतमें शास्त्रकी अनर्थकता आदि दोषोंकी प्राप्ति नहीं मानी गयी। जैसे समस्त द्वैतवादियोंके मतसे बन्धावस्थामें ही शास्त्र आदिकी सार्थकता है मुक्तअवस्थामें नहीं? वैसे ही हमारे मतमें भी जीवोंकी ईश्वरके साथ एकता हो जानेपर यदि शास्त्रकी व्यर्थता होती हो तो हो? अविद्यावस्थामें तो उसकी सार्थकता है ही। पू0 -- हम सब द्वैतवादियोंके सिद्धान्तसे तो आत्माकी बन्धावस्था और मुक्तावस्था वास्तवमें ही सच्ची है। अतः वे हेय? उपादेय हैं और उनके सब साधन भी सत्य हैं। इस कारण शास्त्रकी सार्थकता हो सकती है। परंतु अद्वैतवादियोंके सिद्धान्तसे तो द्वैतभाव अविद्याजन्य और मिथ्या है? अतः आत्मामें बन्धावस्था भी वास्तवमें नहीं है? इसलिये शास्त्रका कोई विषय न रहनेके कारण शास्त्र आदिकी व्यर्थताका दोष आता है। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्माके अवस्थाभेद सिद्ध नहीं हो सकते? यदि ( आत्मामें इनका होना ) मान भी लें तो आत्माकी ये बन्ध और मुक्त दोनों अवस्थाएँ एक साथ होनी चाहिये या क्रमसे स्थिति और गतिकी भाँति परस्परविरोध होनेके कारण दोनों अवस्थाएँ एक साथ तो एकमें हो नहीं सकतीं। यदि क्रमसे होना मानें तो बिना निमित्तके बन्धावस्थाका होना माननेसे तो उससे कभी छुटकारा न होनेका प्रसङ्ग आ जायगा और किसी निमित्तसे उसका होना मानें तो स्वतः न होनेके कारण वह मिथ्या ठहरती है। ऐसा होनेपर स्वीकार किया हुआ सिद्धान्त कट जाता है। इसके सिवा बन्धावस्था और मुक्तावस्थाका आगापीछा निरूपण किया जानेपर पहले बन्धावस्थाका होना माना जायगा तथा उसे आदिरहित और अन्तयुक्त मानना पड़ेगा सो यह प्रमाणविरुद्ध है? ऐसे ही मुक्तावस्थाको भी आदियुक्त और अन्तरहित प्रमाणविरुद्ध ही मानना पड़ेगा। तथा आत्माकी अवस्थावाला और एक अवस्थासे दूसरी अवस्थामें जानेवाला मानकर उसका नित्यत्व सिद्ध करना भी सम्भव नहीं है। जब कि आत्मामें अनित्यत्वके दोषका परिहार करनेके लिये बन्धावस्था और मुक्तावस्थाके भेदकी कल्पना नहीं की जा सकती। इसलिये द्वैतवादियोंके मतसे भी शास्त्रकी व्यर्थता आदि दोष अबाध्य ही हैं। इस प्रकार दोनोंके लिये समान होनेके कारण इस दोषका परिहार केवल अद्वैतवादियोंद्वारा ही किया जाना आवश्यक नहीं है। ( हमारे मतानुसार तो वास्तवमें ) शास्त्रकी व्यर्थता है भी नहीं क्योंकि शास्त्र लोकप्रसिद्ध अज्ञानीका ही विषय है। अज्ञानियोंका ही फल और हेतुरूप अनात्मवस्तुओंमें आत्मभाव होता है? विद्वानोंका नहीं। क्योंकि विद्वान्की बुद्धिमें फल और हेतुसे आत्माका पृथक्त्व प्रत्यक्ष है? इसलिये उसका उन (अनात्मपदार्थों ) में यह मैं हूँ ऐसा आत्मभाव नहीं हो सकता। अत्यन्त मूढ़ और उन्मत्त आदि भी जल और अग्निकी? या छाया और प्रकाशकी एकता नहीं मानते? फिर विवेकीकी तो बात ही क्या है सुतरां फल और हेतुसे आत्माको भिन्न समझ लेनेवाले ज्ञानीके लिये विधिनिषेधविषयक शास्त्र नहीं है। जैसे हे देवदत्त तू अमुक कार्य कर इस प्रकार किसी कर्ममें ( देवदत्तके ) नियुक्त किये जानेपर वहीं खड़ा हुआ विष्णुमित्र उस नियुक्तिको सुनकर भी? यह नहीं समझता कि मैं नियुक्त किया गया हूँ। हाँ? नियुक्तिविषयक विवेकका स्पष्ट ग्रहण न होनेसे तो ऐसा समझना ठीक हो सकता है? इसी प्रकार फल और,हेतुमें भी ( अज्ञानियोंकी आत्मबुद्धि हो सकती है )। पू0 -- फल और हेतुसे आत्माके पृथक्त्वका ज्ञान हो जानेपर भी? स्वाभाविक सम्बन्धकी अपेक्षासे शास्त्रविषयक इतना बोध होना तो युक्तियुक्त ही है कि मैं शास्त्रद्वारा अनुकूल फल और उसके हेतुमें तो प्रवृत्त किया गया हूँ और प्रतिकूल फल और उसके हेतुसे निवृत्त किया गया हूँ? जैसे कि पितापुत्र आदिका आपसमें एक दूसरेको भिन्न समझते हुए भी एक दूसरेके लिये किये हुए नियोग और प्रतिषेधको अपने लिये समझना देखा जाता है। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्माके पृथक्त्वका ज्ञान होनेसे पहलेपहले ही फल और हेतुमें आत्माभिमान होना सिद्ध है। नियोग और प्रतिषेधके अभिप्रायको भली प्रकार जानकर ही मनुष्य फल और हेतुसे आत्माके पृथक्त्वको जान सकता है? उससे पहले नहीं। इससे सिद्ध हुआ कि विधिनिषेधरूप शास्त्रकेवल अज्ञानीके लिये ही है। पू0 -- (इस सिद्धान्तके अनुसार ) स्वर्गकी कामनावाला यज्ञ करे मांस भक्षण न करे इत्यादि विधिनिषेधबोधक शास्त्रवचनोंमें आत्माका पृथक्तव जाननेवालोंकी और केवल देहात्मवादियोंकी भी प्रवृत्ति न होनेसे कर्ताका अभाव हो जानेके कारण शास्त्रके व्यर्थ होनेका प्रसङ्ग आ जायगा उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि प्रवृत्ति और निवृत्तिका होना लोकप्रसिद्धिसे ही प्रत्यक्ष है। ईश्वर और जीवात्माकी एकता देखनेवाला ब्रह्मवेत्ता कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्त नहीं होता तथा आत्मसत्ताको न माननेवाला देहात्मवादी भी परलोक नहीं है ऐसा समझकर शास्त्रानुसार नहीं बर्तता यह ठीक है परंतु लोकप्रसिद्धिसे यह तो हम सबको प्रत्यक्ष है ही कि विधिनिषेधबोधक शास्त्रश्रवणकी दूसरी तरह उपपत्ति न होनेके कारण जिसने आत्माके अस्तित्वका अनुमान कर लिया है? एवं जो आत्माके असली तत्त्वका ज्ञाता नहीं है जिसकी कर्मोंके फलमें तृष्णा है? ऐसा मनुष्य श्रद्धालुताके कारण ( शास्त्रानुसार कर्मोंमें ) प्रवृत्त होता है। अतः शास्त्रकी व्यर्थता नहीं है। पू0 -- विवेकशील पुरुषोंकी प्रवृत्ति न देखनेसे उनका अनुकरण करनेवालोंकी भी ( शास्त्रविहित कर्मोंमें ) प्रवृत्ति नहीं होगी? अतः शास्त्रव्यर्थ हो जायगा। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि किसी एकको ही विवेकज्ञान प्राप्त होता है। अर्थात् अनेक प्राणियोंमेंसे कोई एक ही विवेकी होता है जैसा कि आजकल ( देखा जाता है )। इसके सिवा मूढ़लोग विवेकियोंका अनुकरण भी नहीं करते क्योंकि प्रवृत्ति रागादि दोषोंके अधीन हुआ करती है। ( प्रतिहिंसाके उद्देश्यसे किये जानेवाले जारणमारण आदि ) अभिचारोंमें भी लोगोंकी प्रवृत्ति देखी जाती है तथा प्रवृत्ति स्वाभाविक है। यह कहा भी है कि स्वभाव ही बर्तता है। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि संसार अविद्यामात्र ही है और वह अज्ञानियोंका ही विषय है। केवलशुद्ध क्षेत्रज्ञमें अविद्या और उसके कार्य दोनों ही नहीं हैं। तथा मिथ्याज्ञान परमार्थवस्तुको दूषित करनेमें समर्थ भी नहीं है। क्योंकि जैसे ऊसर भूमिको मृगतृष्णिकाका जल अपनी आर्द्रतासे कीचड़युक्त नहीं कर सकता? वैसे ही अविद्या भी क्षेत्रज्ञका कुछ भी ( उपकार या अपकार ) करनेमें समर्थ नहीं है? इसीलिये क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि और अज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानम् यह कहा है। पू0 -- तो फिर यह क्या बात है कि संसारी पुरुषोंकी भाँति पण्डितोंको भी मैं ऐसा हूँ यह वस्तु मेरी ही है ऐसी प्रतीत होती है। उ0 -- सुनो? यह पाण्डित्य बस इतना ही है जो कि क्षेत्रमें ही आत्माको देखना है परंतु यदि मनुष्य क्षेत्रज्ञको निर्विकारी समझ ले तो फिर मुझे अमुक भोग मिले या मैं अमुक कर्म करूँ ऐसी आकाङ्क्षा नहीं कर सकता? क्योंकि भोग और कर्म दोनों विकार ही तो हैं। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि फलेच्छुक होनेके कारण अज्ञानी कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्त होता है परंतु विकाररहित आत्माका साक्षात् कर लेनेवाले ज्ञानीमें फलेच्छाका अभाव होनेके कारण? उसकी प्रवृत्ति सम्भव नहीं? अतः कार्यकरणसंघातके व्यापारकी निवृत्ति होनेपर उस ( ज्ञानी ) में निवृत्तिका उपचार किया जाता है। किसीकिसीके मतमें यह एक प्रकारकी विद्वत्ता और भी हो सकती है कि? क्षेत्रज्ञ तो ईश्वर ही है और उस क्षेत्रज्ञके ज्ञानका विषय क्षेत्र उससे अलग है तथा मैं तो ( उन दोनोंसे भिन्न ) संसारी और सुखीदुःखी भी हूँ। मुझे क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञके ज्ञान और ध्यानद्वारा ईश्वररूप क्षेत्रज्ञका साक्षात् करके उसके स्वरूपमें स्थित होनारूप साधनसे संसारकी निवृत्ति करनी चाहिये। जो ऐसा समझता है या दूसरेको ऐसा समझाता है कि वह ( जीव ) क्षेत्रज्ञ ( ब्रह्म ) नहीं है तथा जो यह मानता है कि मैं ( इस प्रकारके सिद्धान्तसे ) संसार? मोक्ष और शास्त्रकी सार्थकता सिद्ध करूँगा? वह पण्डितोंमें अधम है। तथा वह आत्महत्यारा? शास्त्रके अर्थकी सम्प्रदायपरम्परासे रहित होनेके कारण? श्रुतिविहित अर्थका त्याग और वेदविरुद्ध अर्थकी कल्पना करके स्वयं मोहित हो रहा है और दूसरोंको भी मोहित करता है। सुतरां जो शास्त्रार्थकी परम्पराको जाननेवाला नहीं है? वह समस्त शास्त्रोंका ज्ञाता भी हो तो भी मूर्खोंके समान उपेक्षणीय ही है। और जो यह कहा था कि ईश्वरकी क्षेत्रज्ञके साथ एकता माननेसे तो ईश्वरमें संसारीपन आ जाता है और क्षेत्रज्ञोंकी ईश्वरके साथ एकता माननेसे कोई संसारी न रहनेके कारण संसारके अभावका प्रसङ्ग आ जाता है? सो विद्या और अविद्याकी विलक्षणताके प्रतिपादनसे इन दोनों दोषोंका ही परिहार कर दिया गया। पू -- कैसे उ0 -- अविद्याद्वारा कल्पित किये हुए दोषसे तद्विषयक पारमार्थिक ( असली ) वस्तु दूषित नहीं होती? इस कथनसे पहली शङ्काका निराकरण किया गया और वैसे ही यह दृष्टान्त भी दिखलाया कि मृगतृष्णिकाके जलसे ऊसर भूमि पङ्कयुक्त नहीं की जा सकती। तथा संसारीका अभाव होनेसे संसारके अभावके प्रसङ्गका जो दोष बतलाया था? उसका भी संसार संसारित्वकी अविद्याकल्पित उपपत्तिको स्वीकार करके निराकरण कर दिया गया। पू0 -- क्षेत्रज्ञका अविद्यायुक्त होना ही तो संसारित्वरूप दोष है? क्योंकि उससे होनेवाले दुःखित्व आदि दोष प्रत्यक्ष देखे जाते हैं। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि जो कुछ ज्ञेय है -- जाननेमें आता है? वह सब क्षेत्रका ही धर्म है? इसलिये,उसके किये हुए दोष ज्ञाता क्षेत्रज्ञके नहीं हो सकते। तू क्षेत्रज्ञपर वास्तवमें बिना हुए ही जो कुछ भी दोष लाद रहा है? वे सब ज्ञेय होनेके कारण क्षेत्रके ही धर्म हैं? क्षेत्रज्ञके नहीं। उनसे क्षेत्रज्ञ ( आत्मा ) दूषित नहीं हो सकता? क्योंकि ज्ञेयके साथ ज्ञाताका संसर्ग नहीं हो सकता। यदि उनका संसर्ग मान लिया जाय तो (ज्ञेयका) ज्ञेयत्व ही सिद्ध नहीं हो सकता। अभिप्राय यह है कि यदि अविद्यायुक्त होना और दुखी होना आदि आत्माके धर्म हैं तो वे प्रत्यक्ष कैसे दीखते हैं और वे क्षेत्रज्ञके धर्म हो भी कैसे सकते हैं क्योंकि जो कुछ भी ज्ञेय वस्तु है वह सब क्षेत्र है और क्षेत्रज्ञ ज्ञाता है? ऐसा सिद्धान्त स्थापित किये जानेपर फिर अविद्यायुक्त होना और दुखी होना आदि दोषोंको क्षेत्रज्ञके धर्म बतलाना और उनकी प्रत्यक्ष उपलब्धि भी मानना? यह सब अज्ञानमात्रके आश्रयसे केवल विरुद्ध प्रलाप करना है। पू0 -- वह अविद्या किसमें है उ0 -- जिसमें दीखती है उसीमें। पू0 -- किसमें दीखती है उ0 -- अविद्या किसमें दीखती है -- यह प्रश्न ही निरर्थक है। पू0 -- किस प्रकार उ0 -- यदि अविद्या दीखती है तो उससे जो युक्त है उसको भी तू अवश्य देखता ही होगा फिर अविद्यावान्की उपलब्धि हो जानेपर वह अविद्या किसमें है? यह पूछना ठीक नहीं है। क्योंकि गौवालेको देख लेनेपर यह गौ किसकी है यह पूछना सार्थक नहीं हो सकता। पू0 -- तुम्हारा यह दृष्टान्त विषय है। गौ और उसका स्वामी तो प्रत्यक्ष होनेके कारण उनका सम्बन्ध भी प्रत्यक्ष है इसलिये ( उनके सम्बन्धके विषयमें ) प्रश्न निरर्थक है? परंतु उनकी भाँति अविद्यावान् और अविद्या तो प्रत्यक्ष नहीं हैं? जिससे कि यह प्रश्न निरर्थक माना जाय उ0 -- अप्रत्यक्ष अविद्यावान्के साथ अविद्याका सम्बन्ध जान लेनेसे तुम्हें क्या मिलेगा पू0 -- अविद्या अनर्थकी हेतु है? इसलिये उसका त्याग किया जा सकेगा। उ0 -- जिसमें अविद्या है? वह उसका स्वयं त्याग कर देगा। पू0 -- मुझमें ही तो अविद्या है। उ0 -- तब तो तू अविद्या और उससे युक्त अपने आपको जानता है। पू0 -- जानता तो हूँ परंतु प्रत्यक्षरूपसे नहीं। उ0 -- यदि अनुमानसे जानता है तो ( तुझ ज्ञाता और अविद्याके ) सम्बन्धका ग्रहण कैसे हुआ क्योंकि उस,समय ( अविद्याको अनुमानसे जाननेके कालमें ) तुझ ज्ञाताका ज्ञेयरूप अविद्याके साथ सम्बन्ध ग्रहण नहीं किया जा सकता? कारण यह है कि ज्ञाताका विषय मानकर ही अविद्याका उपयोग किया गया है। तथा ज्ञाता और अविद्याके सम्बन्धको जो ग्रहण करनेवाला है वह तथा उस ( अविद्या और ज्ञाताके सम्बन्ध ) को विषय करनेवाला कोई दूसरा ज्ञान ये दोनों ही सम्भव नहीं हैं। क्योंकि ऐसा होनेसे अनवस्थादोष प्राप्त होता है अर्थात् यदि ज्ञाता और ज्ञेयज्ञाताका सम्बन्ध ये भी ( किसीके द्वारा ) जाने जाते हैं? ऐसा माना जाय तो उसका ज्ञाता किसी औरको मानना होगा। फिर उसका भी दूसरा और उसका भी दूसरा ज्ञाता मानना होगा? इस प्रकार यह अनवस्था अनिवार्य हो जायगी। पंरतु ज्ञेय चाहे अविद्या हो अथवा और कुछ हो? ज्ञेय ज्ञेय ही रहेगा ( ज्ञाता नहीं हो सकता ) वैसे ही ज्ञाता भी ज्ञाता ही रहेगा? ज्ञेय नहीं हो सकता? जब कि ऐसा है तो अविद्या या दुःखित्व आदि दोषोंसे ज्ञाता -- क्षेत्रज्ञका कुछ भी दूषित नहीं हो सकता। पू0 -- यही उसका दोष है जो कि वह दोषयुक्त क्षेत्रका ज्ञाता है। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्मा विज्ञानस्वरूप और अविक्रिय है? उसमें ( इस ) ज्ञातापनका उपचारमात्र किया जाता है? जैसे कि उष्णतामात्र स्वभाव होनेसे अग्निमें तपानेकी क्रियाका उपचार किया जाता है। जैसे भगवान्ने यहाँ ( इस प्रकरणमें ) यह दिखाया है कि आत्मामें स्वभावसे ही क्रिया? कारक और फलात्मत्वका अभाव है? केवल अविद्याद्वारा अध्यारोपित होनेके कारण क्रिया? कारक आदि आत्मामें उपचरित होते हैं? वैसे ही? जो इसे मारनेवाला जानता है प्रकृतिके गुणोंद्वारा ही सब कर्म किये जाते हैं ( वह विभु ) किसीके पापपुण्यको ग्रहण नहीं करता इत्यादि प्रकरणोंमें जगहजगह दिखाया गया है और इसी प्रकार हमने व्याख्या भी की है? तथा आगेके प्रकरणोंमें भी हम दिखलायेंगे। पू0 -- तब तो आत्मामें स्वभावसे क्रिया? कारक और फलात्मत्वका अभाव सिद्ध होनेसे तथा ये सब अविद्याद्वारा अध्यारोपित सिद्ध होनेसे यही निश्चय हुआ कि कर्म अविद्वान्को ही कर्तव्य है? विद्वान्को नहीं। उ0 -- ठीक यही सिद्ध हुआ। इसी बातको हम न हि देहभृता शक्यम् इस प्रकरणमें और सारे गीताशास्त्रके उपसंहारप्रकरणमें दिखलायेंगे। तथा सामसेनैव कौन्तेय निष्ठा ज्ञानस्य या परा इस श्लोकके अर्थमें विशेषरूपसे दिखायेंगे। बस? यहाँ अब और अधिक विस्तारकी आवश्यकता नहीं है? इसलिये उपसंहार किया जाता है।",
      "English": "Ca api, and; viddhi, understand; mam, Me, the supreme God who is transcendental; to be the ksetrajnam, 'Knower of the field' with the characterisitics noted above; sarva-ksetresu, in all the fields. The idea is this: Know the 'Knower of the field'- who has become diversified by limiting adjuncts in the form of numerous 'fields' ranging from Brahma to a clump of grass-as free from differentiations resulting from all the limiting adjuncts, and as beyond the range of such words and ideas as existece, nonexistence, etc. O scion of the Bharata dynasty, since there remains nothing to be known apart from the true nature of the field, the knower of the field and God, therefore; tat, that; is jnanam, Knowledge, right knowledge; yat, which; is the jnanam, knowledge; ksetra-ksetrajnayoh, of the field and the knower of the field-which are the two knowables-, and by which Knowledge the field and the knower of the field are made objects of knowledge. This is mama, My, God Vishu's; matam, opinion. Objection: Well, if it be that in all the field there exists God alone, and none else other than Him, as the enjoyer, then God will become a mundane being; or, due to the absence of any mundane creature other than God, there will arise the contingency of the negation of mundance existence. And both these are undesirable, since the scriptures dealing with bondage, Liberation and their causes will become useless, and also becuase they contradict such valid means of knowledge as direct perception. In the first place, mundane existence which is characterized by happiness, sorrow and their cause is apprehended through direct perception. Besides, from the perception of variety in the world it can be inferred that mundane existence results from virtue and vice. All this becomes illogical if God and the individual soul be one. Reply: No, because this becomes justifiable owing to the difference between Knowledge and ignorance. 'These two, viz that which is know as Knowledge and that which is known as ignorance are widely contradictory, and they follow divergent courses' (Ka. 1.2.4.); and similarly, the different results, viz Liberation and enjoyment, belonging (respectively) to those Knowledge and ignorance, have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that Liberation is the goal of Knowledge, and enjoyment is the result of ignorance (see Ka. 1.2.2). Vyasa, also has said so: 'Now, there are these two paths' (Mbh Sa. 241.6) etc. and, 'There are only these two paths,' etc. Here (in the Gita) also, two kinds of steadfastness have been stated. And it is understood from the Vedas, the Smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by Knowledge. As for the Vedic texts, they are: 'If one has realized here, then there is truth; if he has not realized here, then there is great destruction' (Ke. 2.5); 'Knowing Him in this way, one becomes Immortal here' (Nr. Pu. 6); 'There is no other path to go by' (Sv. 3.8); 'The enlightened man is not afraid of anything' (Tai. 2.9.1). On the other hand, (the texts) with regard to the unenlightened person are: 'Then, he is smitten with fear' (Tai. 2.7.1); 'Living in the midst of ognorance' (Ka. 1.2.5); One who knows Brahman becomes Brahman indeed. In his line is not born anyone who does not know Brahman' (Mu. 3.2.9); '(While he who worships another god thinking,) \"He is one, and I am another,\" does not know. He is like an animal to the gods' (Br. 1.4.10). He who is a knower of the Self, 'He becomes all this (Universe)' (Br. 1.4.10); 'When men will fold up space like (folding) leather, (then) there will be cessation of sorrow, without knowing the Deity' (Sv. 6.9). There are thousands of texts like these. And the Smrti texts (from the Gita) are: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance. Thery the creatures become deluded' (5.15); 'Here itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness' (5.19); 'Since by seeing eally the God who is present alike everywhere (he does not injure the Self by the Self, therefore he attains the supreme Goal)' (13.28), etc. And as for reason, there is the text, 'Men avoid snakes, tips of kusa-grass as also well when they are aware of them. Some fall into them owing to ignorance. Thus, see the special result arising from knowledge' (Mbh. Sa. 201.17). Similarly, it is known that an unelightened person, who identifies himself with the body etc. and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion, takes birth and dies. It cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that, those who see the Self as different from the body etc. become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct, which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion. The being so, the Knower of the field, who is reality is God Himself, appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance; as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body etc. For it is a well-known fact in the case of all creatures that their self-identify with the body etc. which are not-Self is definitely caused by ignorance. Just as, when a stump, of a tree is firmly regarded as a man, the alities of a man do not thery come to exist in the stump, nor do the alities of the stump come to the person, similarly the property ofconsciousness does not come to the body, nor those of the body to consciousness. It is not proper that the Self should be identified with happiness, sorrow, delusion, etc., since they, like decrepitude and death, are eally the products of ignorance. Objection: May it not be said that this is not so, becuase of dissimilarity? The stump and the man, which are verily objects of perception, are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver. On the other hand, in the case of the body and the Self,, the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception. Thus, the illustration is not eally applicable. Therefore, may it not be that the properties of the body, though objects of knowledge, belong to the Self which is the knower? Reply: No, since there arises the contingency of (the Self) becoming devoid of consciousness! If alities such as happiness, sorrow, delusion, desire, etc. of the body etc., which are the field and are objects of knowledge, indeed belong to the knower, then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the alities of the object of knowledge-the field-superimposed through ignorance belong to the Self, while decrepitude, death, etc. do not. (On the contrary) it is possible to infer that they (happiness etc.) do not pertain to the Self, since, like decrepitude etc., they are superimposed on the Self through ignorance, and because they are either avoidable or acceptable. This being so, the mundane state, consisting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge, is superimposed on the knower through ignorance. Hence, nothing of the knower is affected thery-in the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface, diret, etc. (on it) by fools. Such being the case, not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty [see footnote on p.5, and p.168.] God, the Knower of the field, even though He exists in all the fields. For it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a ality attributed to him through ignorance. As for the statement that the illustration is not eally applicable-that is wrong. Objection: How? Reply: Because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance. There is no disagreement as to that. However, as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the Knower, that too has been shown to be inapt by citing the example of decrepitude etc. [If it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another, but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer, the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition. For decrepitude and death, which are matters of experience, are superimposed on the Self, the experiencer.] Objection: May it not be that the Knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance? Reply: No, because ignorance is of the nature of tamas. Since ignorance has the nature of covering, it is indeed a notion born of tamas; it makes one perceive contrarily, or it arouses doubt, or it leads to non-perception. For it disappears with the dawn of discrimination. And the three kind of ignorance, viz non-perception etc. [Etc: false perception and doubt.], are experienced when there are such defects as blindness etc. which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling. [It is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception etc. arise from some defects,and they are not the alities of the Self.] Objection: Here it is asserted that if this be the case, then ignorance is a ality of the knower? Reply: No, for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is an organ. As for your notion that 'ignorance is a ality of the experiencer, and the very fact of being possessed of the ality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the Knower of the field; the assertion which was made (by the Vedantin) in that connection, \"that the Knower of th field is God Himself and not a mundane being, \" is improper,'-this is not so. As for example: Since such defects as false perception etc. are seen to belong to the organ eye, therefore false perception etc. or their causes, viz defects like blindness etc., do not belong to the perceiver. Just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver, similarly notions like non-perception, false perception, doubt, and their causes should, in all cases, pertain to some organ; not to the perceiver, the Knower of the field. And since they are objects of perception, they are not alities of the Knower in the same way that light is of a lamp. Just because they are objects of perception, they are cognized as different from one's own Self. Besides, it is denied by all schools of thought that in Liberation, when all the organs depart, there is any association with such defects as ignorance etc. If they (the defects) be the alities of the Self Itself, the Knower of the field, as heat is of fire, then there can never be a dissociation from them. Again, since there can be no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable, formless Self which is all-pervading like space, therefore it is established that the Knower of the field is ever identical with God. This follows alos from the utternance of the Lord, 'Being without beginning and without alities' (31), etc. Objection: Well, if this be so, then, owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures, there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures, etc. Reply: No, since this (defect) is admitted by all. A defect that is admitted by all who believe in the Self is not to be explained by one alone! Objection: How has this been admitted by all? Reply: People of all schools of thought who believe in the Self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones. Yet, in their case (i.e. in those various schools), it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless, etc. Similarly, in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with God; and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance. This is just as in the case of all the dualists, where it is admitted that the scriptures etc. become useful in the state of bondage, not in the state of Liberation. Objection: Well, for us all dualists, bondage and Liberation of the Self are real in the truest sense. So, when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real, the scriptures etc. become meaningful. On the other hand, may it not be that for the non-dualists, since duality deos not exist in truest sense, it being the creation of ignorance, therefore the state of bondage of the Self is not ultimately real, and hence the scriptures etc. become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subject-matter? Reply: No, since it is not logical that the Self should have different states. If this were possible at all, then the states of bondage and freedom of the Self should be simultaneous, or successive. As to that, they cannot occur simultaneously, since they are contradictory-like rest and motion in the same object. Should they occur successively and without being caused, then there will arise the contingency of there being no Liberation; if they occur through some cause, then, since they do not exist inherently, there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unreal. In this case also the assumption becomes falsified. Moreover, when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and Liberation, the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier and having no beginning, but an end. And that is contrary to valid means of knowledge. Similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of Liberation has a beginning, but no end- which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge. And it is not possible to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another. On the other hand, if for avoiding the defect of non-eternality the different states of bondage and Liberation be not assumed, then, even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable. Thus, the situation being similar (for both), it is not for the Advaitin (alone) to refute the objection. Nor do the scriptures become purposeless, because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person. It is indeed in the case of the ignorant person-not in the case of the enlightened one-that there occurs the perception of identity of the Self with the effect (i.e. enjoyership) and the cause (i.e. agentship) which are not-Self. For, in the case of the enlightened persons, it is impossible that, after the dawn of the realization of non-identity of the Self with effect and cause, they can have Self identification with these as 'I'. Surely, not even a downright fool, or a lunatic and such others, see water and fire or shade and light as identical; what to speak of a discriminating person! Therefore, such being the case, the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a person who sees the distinction of the Self from effect and cause. For, when Devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words, 'You do this,' Visnumitra who happens to be there does not, even on hearing the ?nd, conclude, 'I have been ordered.' But this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood. So also with regard to cause and effect. Objection: Can it not be that, even after having realized the Self as different from effect and cuase, it is ite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship, [Natural relationship-Self-identification with the body through ignorance.] that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding, 'I am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result, and am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result'? As for instance, in the case of a father and son, or between others, even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other, still there is the comprehension of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other. [In the (Br. (1.5.17) we read, 'Now therefore the entrusting: When a man thinks he will die, he says to his son, \"You are Brahman, you are the sacrifice, and you are the world,\"' etc. It has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father. Similarly, it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties, the father has to accept them. So also in the case of brothers and others. Thus, in the case of the enlightened person also, though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause, still, owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance, body, etc., there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him.] Reply: No, since identification of the Self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the Self as distinct (from them). It is only after one has followed (or eschewed) what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause; not before. [In B.S. (3.4.26-7) it is said that the merit earned by the performance of scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of Brahman. Therefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened. (By following what is enjoined, and avoiding what is prohibited, one's mind becomes purified, and then only one understands he is different from cause and effect-agentship and enjoyership.-Tr.)] Therefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant. Objection: Well, if (injunctions and prohibitions) such as, 'One who desires heaven shall perform sacrifices', 'One should not eat poisoned meat,' etc. be not observed by those who have realized the Self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the Self, then, from the absence of any observer of those (injunctions etc.) there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures. Reply: No, because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures. As for one who has realized the identity of the Lord and the knower of the field, one who has realized Brahman-he does not engage in action. Similarly, even the person who does not believe in the Self does not engage in action, under the idea that the other world does not exist. However, one who has inferred the existence of the Self on the ground of the wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless, who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the Self, and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actions-he faithfully engages in action. This is a matter of direct perception to all to us. Hence, the scriptures are not purposeless. Objection: May it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when, by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discrimination, their followers too will abstain? Reply: No, because discrimination arises in some rare person only. For, as at present, some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination. Besides, fools do not follow one who has discrimination, because (their) engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment etc. And they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic. Moreover, engagement in action is natural. Verily has it been said (by the Lord), 'But it is Nature that acts' (5.14). Therefore, the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance, and is an object of perception (to the ignorant man who sees it) just as it appears to him. Ignorance and its effects do not belong to the Knower of the feild, the Absolute. Moreover, false knowledge cannot taint the supreme Reality. For, water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme Reality. For, water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture. Similarly, ignorance cannot act in any way on the Knower of the field. Hence has this been said, 'And understand Me to be knower of the field,' as also, 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance' (5.15). Objection: Then, what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people, 'Thus [Possessed of aristorcracy etc.] am I,' 'This [Body, wife, etc.] verily belongs to Me'? Reply: Listen. This is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the Self! On the contrary, should they realize the unchanging Knower of the field, then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea, 'May this be mine.' Enjoyment and action are mere perversions. This being so, the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results. On the other hand, in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless Self, engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results. Hence, when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease, his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense. Some may have this other kind of learnedness: 'The Knower of the field is God Himself; and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the Knower of the field. But I am a mundane being, happy and sorrowful. And it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowledge of the field and the Knower of the field, and by continuing to dwell in His true nature after directly perceiving through meditation God, the Knower of the field,' and he who, understands thus, and he who teaches that 'he (the taught) is not the Knower of the field,' and he who, being under such an idea, thinks, 'I shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and Liberation'-is the meanest among the learned. That Self-immolator, being devoid of any link with the traditional interpreters of the purport of the scriptures, misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there, and thery himself becoming deluded, befools others too. Hence, one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool, though he may be versed in all the scriptures. As for the objection that, if God be one with the knower of the field, He will then become a mundane being, and that, if the knowers of the fields are one with God, then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state, -these two objections have been refuted by admitting Knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics. Objection: How? Reply: By saying that any defect imagined through ignorance does not affect the supreme Reality which is the substratum of that (imagination). In accordance with this an illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage. Even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mundange state, conseent on the nonexistence of individual souls, stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance. Objection: The defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consists in his being possessed of ignorance. And sorrowfulness etc. which are its products are matters of direct experience. Reply: No, since whatever is known is an attribute of the field, therefore the knower-the knower of the field-cannot reasonably be tainted by the defects arising from it. Whatsoever blemish-not existing in the knower of the field-you attribute to It is logically an object of experience, and hence it is verily a ality of the field; not the ality of the knower of the field. Nor does the knower of the field become tainted thery, because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge. Should there be a conjunction, then there will be no possibility at all of its (the latter's) becoming a knowable. Oh! Sir, if being ignorant, sorrowful, etc. be alities of the Self, how is it that they are directly perceived? Or how can they be alities of the Knower of the field? If the conclusion be that all that is known consititutes the field, and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field, then, to say that being ignorant, sorrowful, etc.are the alities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis. Here, (the opponent) asks: To whom does ignorance belong? (The answer is that) it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced! Objection: In whom is it perceived? Reply: Here the answer is: It is pointless to ask, 'In whom is ignorance experienced?' Objection: How? Reply: If ignorance be perceived (by you), then you perceive its possessor as well. Moreover, when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask, 'In whom is it perceived?' For, when an owner of cattle is seen, the estion, 'To whom do the cattle belong', does not become meaningful. Objection: Well, is not the illustration dissimilar? Since, the cattle and their owner are directly perceived, their relation also is directly perceived. Hence the estion is meaningless. Ignorance and its possessor are not directly perceived in that manner, in which case the estion would have been meaningless. Reply: What will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed of ignorance? Opponent: Since ignorance is a source of evil, therefore it should be got rid of. Reply: He to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it! Opponent: Indeed, ignorance belongs to myself. Reply: In that case, you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it? Opponent: I know, but not through direct perception. Reply: If you know through inference, then how is the connection (between yourself and ignorance) known? Surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time ['When you are knowing your own ignorance.'] the knowledge of the relation (of the Self) with ignorance which is an object of knowledge; ['After having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge, how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance? For this would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition.'] because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object. Besides, there cannot be someone who is a (separate) cognizer of the relation between the knower and ignorance, and a separate cognition of that (relation), for this would lead to infinite regress. If the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable, then a separate cognizer has to be imagined. Of him, again, another knower has to be imagined; of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined! Thus, an infinite regress be comes unavoidable. Again, whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else, a knowable is verily a knowable; similarly, even a knower is surely a knower; he does not become a knowable. And when this is so, [Since the knower cannot be known, therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else] nothing of the cognizer-the knower of the field-is tainted by such defects as ignorance, sorrowfulness, etc. Objection: May it not be said that the (Self's) defect is surely this, that the field, which is full of defects, is cognized (by It)? Reply: No, because it is the Immutable, which is consciousness, by nature, that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer. It is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its (natural) heat. Just as it has been shown here by the Lord Himself that identification with action, cause and effect are absent in the Self, and that action, cause, etc. are figuratively attributed to the Self owing to their having been superimposed (on It) through ignorance, so has it been shown by Him in various places: 'He who thinks of this One as the killer৷৷.' (2.19), 'While actions are being done in ever way by the gunas of Nature' (3.27), 'The Omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin৷৷.' (5.15), etc. It has been explained by us, too, in that very way, and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly. Objection: Well, in that case, if identification with action, cause and effect be naturally absent in the Self, and it they be superimpositions through ignorance, then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant, not by the enlightened. Reply: It is true that is comes to this. This very fact we shall explain under the verse, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body৷৷.' (18.11). And, in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole Scripture, we shall explain this elaborately under the verse, '৷৷.in brief indeed, O son of Kunti,৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge' (ibid. 50) It is needless here to expatiate further, Hence we conclude. The next verse, '(Hear about)৷৷.what that field is,' etc., summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the 'field' taught in the verses begining from 'This body৷৷.'etc., is being presented. For it is proper to introduce briefly the subject-matter that is sought to be explained."

    "Ramanujacharya": {
      "Hindi": "",
      "English": "Know as Myself the Field-knower also who is the only form of the Knower in all the bodies like divinities, men etc., i.e., know them as ensouled by Me. By the expression 'also' (Api) in, 'Know Me also (Api) as the Field-Knower,' it is inferable that 'Know Me as the Field-Knower in all Fields' has also been taught by implication. Just as the body, on account of its being the attribute of the knower, cannot exist separately, and is conseently denoted by way of co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikarnya) with it, in the same manner both the Field and the Field-Knower, on account of their being My attributes, cannot exist as entities separate from Me, and hence can be denoted as 'one with Me' by way of co-ordinate predication. Both the Ksetra (Field) which is an aggregate of earth etc., and the Ksetrajna (the Jiva) have the Lord for their Self, because of their being of the nature of the body of the Lord. Such is the teaching of the Sruti passages beginning from 'He who dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body is the earth, who controls the earth from within - He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br. U., 3.7.3), and ending with 'He who, dwelling in the individual self as the self within, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is, who controls the self from within - He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.22). It is the dwelling in of the Lord as the Self of all the knowers of the bodies (Field-Knowers or the Jivas) on account of His being the inner Controller, that is the justification for describing Him as in co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) with them. In the beginning and later on, it was taught to the effect, 'I am the self, O Arjuna, dwelling in the hearts of all beings' (10.20), and 'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me' (10.39) and 'I, with a single aspect of Myself, am sustaining the whole universe' (10.42). In the middle He describes Himself by way of co-ordinate predication as, 'Of Adityas, I am Visnu' etc. In the teachings concerning the difference between the body and its knower and concerning both of them as having Me for their Self - this knowledge of unity by co-ordinate predication alone is taught as 'My view.' Some (the followers of Advaita and Bhedabheda) say: The sentence 'And know Me as the Knower' should be understood as co-ordinate predication expressing identity between the individual self and the Supreme Self. Thus according to their view, the Lord (Isvara), who is Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute must be admitted to have become the individual self, as it were, through nescience (Ajnana). According to their docrine the teaching of identity given here in the Text seeks to sublate that nescience. Just as teaching by a reliable person to the effect, 'This is a rope, and not a snake,' sublates the erroneous notion of a snake, the teaching of the Lord, who is most reliable, sublates the erroneous notion of the individual self (Ksetrjna) being different from Him. Such interpreters are to be estioned thus: Is this Teacher, Bhagavan Vasudeva, the Supreme Ruler, one whose nescience has been sublated by the exact knowledge of the Self or not? If His nescience has been sublated, then the perception of duality like Arjuna as the taught, and of actions like teaching, becomes impossible, because of the impossibility of superimposing a flase form on the Self which is in reality mere undifferentiated Consciousness. If, however, His nescience has not been sublated on account of His not having realised the Self, then, because of His ignorance, it is utterly impossible for Him to teach the knowledge of the Self. Elsewhere it has been stated: 'The wise, who have realised the truth, will instruct you in knowledge' (4.34). Thus, the polemics of this nature are to be ignored as having been set forth to misguide the world by these ignorant daters whose arguments are contradicted by all Vedas, Smrtis, Itihasas, the Puranas, logic and their own words. The truth is this: Some of the Sruti texts declare that non-conscient matter, the conscient entity (the individual self) and the Supreme Brahman are different in nature from one another in the relation of object of enjoyment, the enjoyer (subject) and the Supreme Ruler as follows: 'From Prakrti, the Possessor of Maya projects this world, in which another (i.e. the individual self) is confined by Maya (Sve. U., 4.9); 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the Possessor of Maya to be the Great Lord' (Sve. U., 4.10); 'The perishable is Prakrti; the immortal and imperishable is Hara (the individual self); and the Lord alone rules over both the perishable Prakrti and the imperishable individual self' (Sve. U., 1.10). Here, the expression, 'The immortal and the imperishable is Hara,' points out the enjoyer (i.e., individual self); It is called Hara because the individual self siezes matter as an object of It own experience. Again, 'He is the cause, the Lord of the lord of senses' (Ibid., 6.9); 'He has no progenitor and no Lord' (Ibid., 6.9); 'He is the ruler of Prakrti, of the individual self, and the Lord of alities' (Ibid., 6.16); 'He is the Lord of the Universe, the Ruler of individual selves, the eternal, the auspicious and the unchanging' (Ma. Na., 13.3); 'The two unborn - the knowing Lord and the unknowing individual self, the omnipotent and the impotent' (Sve. U.,1.9); 'The Constant among inconstants, the Intelligent among the intelligents, the one who grants the desires of the many' (Ibid., 6.13. & Ka. U., 5.13); 'When one knows the enjoyer, the object of enjoyment and Actuater ৷৷.' (Sve. U., 1.12); 'Regarding the individual self and the Actuater to be different, and blessed by Him, It attains immortality' (Ibid., 1.6), and 'Ot these two, the one eats the sweet Pippala fruit, the other shines in his splendour without eating' (Ibid., 4.6 and Mun. U., 3.1.1). Further, 'There is one unborn female, red, white and black, who produces many creatures like herself; there is another unborn being who loves her and is close to her; there is yet another male unborn who after having enjoyed here, gives her up' (Ibid., 4.5); 'The cow (i.e. Prakrti) that has no beginning or end, is the mother and source of all beings' (Cha. U., 4.5) and 'On the self-same tree, the individual self sits sunken in grief, and being ignorant and impotent, It grieves. When It sees the other, the gracious Lord and His glory, It attains freedom from grief (Sve. U., 4.7). The following passages of the Gita are alos to the point: 'This Prakrti, thus divided eightfold, composed of Ahankara etc., is Mine.' 'This is My lower Prakrti. Know My higher Prakrti to be distinct from this - the Life Principle, by which the universe is sustained (7.4-5); 'All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Nature at the end of a cycle. These I send forth again at the beginning of a cycle. Resorting to Prakrti, which is My own, I send forth again and again all this multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakrti' (9.7-8); 'Under my control, Prakrti gives birth to all that moves, and that which does not move. And because of this, O Arjuna, does the world spin' (9.10); 'Know that Prakrti and the individual self are without beginning' (13.19) 'The great Brahman (or Prakrti) is My womb; in that I lay the germ; from it, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings' (14.3). The great Brahman of Mine, which is the womb of this world, called Prakti, non-conscient matter, consisting of elements in a subtle state - in it I lay the germ called conscient entity. From that, namely, from the compound between conscient and unconscient entities, which is willed by Me, are born all these beings beginning with the gods and ending with the immobile things mixed up with the unconscient matter. Such is the meaning. In the Sruti also, the subtle original state of material elements is signified as Brahman: 'From Him are produced Brahman as also the world of matter and soul (Anna) having name and form' (Mun. U., 1.1.9). Likewise, Sruti Texts declare that the Supreme Person constitutes the Self of all, and the conscient and non-conscient entities are inseparable from Him; for, those conscient and unconscient entities, which abide in the form of the experiencer and the experienced abiding in all states, form the body of the Supreme Person; conseently they are under His control. These Texts are as follows: 'He who, dwelling in the earth, is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is, who is the Inner Ruler of the earth' and ending with, 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who is the Inner Controller of the self' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7.3-22). Likewise another passage declares: 'He who is moving withing the earth, to whom the earth is the body, whom the earth does not know ৷৷. he who is moving within the Mrtyu (Nature), to whom Mrtyu is the body, whom Mrtyu does not know ৷৷. He is the Inner Self of all beings, sinless; He is the divine Lord, He is of the one Narayana' (Sub. U., 7). Here the term Mrtyu denotes the subtle state of non-conscient entity which is expressed by the term Tamas, because in the same Upanisad, it is declared, 'The unmanifest (Avyakta) merges into Aksara (the imperishable), and the Aksara merges into Tamas (Ibid., 2). Elsewhere it is stated thus: 'Entering within, is the Ruler of all creatures, the self of all (Tai. A., 3.21). Therefore, the Supreme Person, who posseses conscient and non-conscient entities abiding in all states as His body, is in the form of the world, whether in the state of cause or of effect. So, with the purpose of making this explicit, some Srutis declare that the world in its states as cause and effect, is He Himself. They begin with, 'This Existence (Sat) alone was in the beginning, one only without a second ৷৷. It thought, \"May I become many, may I multiply\". It creates Tejas' (Cha. U., 6.2.1.2), and ends with 'All creatures here, my dear, have their root in the Sat (Being), have their home in the Sat, have Sat as their support. All this has Sat for its self. That is Existence. He is the Self. That you are, O Svetaketu' (Cha. U., 6.8.4.6-7). Elsewhere is the following text beginning with, 'He desired, \"May I become many\"; He performed austerity; having performed austerity, He created all this,' and concluding with, 'He became both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter), He has remained true to His nature' (Tai. U., 2.6.1). The difference in nature between conscient and unconscient entities and the Supreme Person, established in the other Sruti passages, is asserted here also: 'Lo! Entering into these three divinities (i.e. the Tejas, water and earth) in the form of living self (individual self), which is Myself, I distinguish name and form? (Cha. U., 6.3.2) and also in the text, 'Having created it, He entered into it. Having entered it, He became Sat and Tyat ৷৷. He became both conscious and unconscious, both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter). He has remained true to His own nature' (Tai. U., 2.6.1). It is in this way that all the distinctions of names and forms are brought about: The Sruti also declares, 'Then, this was undifferentiated. Now, it has been differentiated by names and forms' (Br. U., 1.4.7). Therefore, He who exists in the states of effect and cause, and who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their gross and subtle states as His body, is the Supreme Person. Because the effect is not other than the cause, the effect becomes known when the cause is known, when the One becomes known, everything is known - thus what is posited by the Srutis stands explained. In the text, 'Entering into these three divinities by way of living self (individual self) which is My self, I distinguish name and form' (Cha. U., 6.3.2) - all the non-conscient entities are pointed out by the expression, 'the three divinities', and then the distinguishing of names and forms arises on account of the individual selves having Him for Their Self, entering into those entities. Thus all expressive terms signify the Supreme Self who is alified by the individual selves and non-conscient matter. Therefore, co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) of a term denoting an effect with a term denoting the Supreme Self as cause, is ite appropriate. Thus the Supreme Brahman, who has conscient and non-conscient entities in their gross and subtle conditions as His modes, is Himself the effect and the cause; so Brahman is the material cause of the world. Brahman Himself constitutes the material cause of the world, because Brahman, who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their subtle state as His body, forms the cause of all. Still as that material cause is a composite entity (i.e., of individual selves, Prakrti aand Isvara), there is no mixing up of the natures of Brahman, conscient entities and non-conscient entities. This is perfectly tenable. Thus, for example, although the material cause of a multi-coloured cloth is a combination of white, black and red threads, the connection of whiteness etc., with the cloth is to be found only in the place where a particular kind of thread is woven in it; in the state of effect also, there is no mixing up of the colours everywhere. Similarly, although the world has for its material cause a combination of the Lord, conscient and non-conscient entities, still in its condition as an effect also, there is no mixing up of the respective alities of experiencer (subject), the experienced (object) and the Controller (God). Though these threads can exist separately they are brought together at a time by man's will and acire the character and effect as a conseence. But in the case of the world manifestation, there is a unieness. It consists in that the intelligent and insentient entities in both causal and effect conditions derive their existential nature only from, and as, modes of the Supreme Person, by forming His body. Thus the Supreme Person having those entities as His body, is always signified by all these terms indicating them. As for the differences in nature, their respective speciality of character holds good here (i.e., in the production of world as of the coloured cloth). Such being the case, though the Supreme Brahman enters the effect, owing to absence of transformation of His nature, the unchangeability is well established. To signify Brahman as effect is also very appropriate, because He is the Self sustaining the conscient and non-conscient entities from within their gross condition when they are differentiated by name and form: What is called effect is nothing other than the cause passing into another state of existence. The various scriptural statements that the Supreme Brahman is without attributes are also tenable in the sense that He is not associated with evil attributes, as the Sruti text, 'He is free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless' eliminates all evil attributes, and then says that He is full of auspicious attributes: 'Whose desire is real, whose will is real' (Cha. U., 8.7.1). This Sruti text itself settles here what was generally declared elsewhere that negation of attributes (Guna-nisedha) pertains to evil attributes in Brahman. The doctrine that Brahman is of the nature of knowledge is also ite appropriate, because it amounts to saying that the true nature of Brahman, who is omniscient and omnipotent, who is antagonistic to all that is evil, and who is the mine of all auspicious attributes, can be adeately defined only as Knowledge, as one whose nature is Knowledge, since He possesses self-luminosity. The following texts teach that Brahman is the Knower: 'He who is all-knowing, all wise' (Mun. U., 1.1.9); 'His high power is revealed, indeed, as various and natural, as consisting of knowledge, strength and activity' (Sve.U., 6.8); 'My dear, by what means has one to understand the Knower?' (Br. U., 2.4.14); and the text, 'Brahman is Existence, Knowledge and Infinity' (Tai. U., 2.1.1). All these teach that Brahman is of the nature of Knowledge in as much as He can be defined only as Knowledge, and because also He is self-luminous. In the texts 'He desired, \"May I become many\" ' (Tai. U., 2.6.1), 'It thought, \"May I become many\" ' (Cha. U., 6.2.3), 'It became differentiated by names and forms' - it is affirmed that Brahman thus exists of His own Will in a wonderful plurality of modes on account of His having the immovable and movable entities as His body. Conseently it is false to affirm the opposite view that the manifold entities do not have Brahman as their self in a real sense. Thus, it is the unreality of manifold existence (i.e., of entities without Brahman for the Self) that is denied in the following texts: 'He obtains death after death who sees difference here' (Ka. U., 2.4.10), 'There is nothing here that is manifold' (Ka. U., 2.4.11), 'But where there is duality, as it were, there one sees another ৷৷. but where everything has become the self ৷৷. there, by what can one see what ৷৷. who shall know which by what?' (Br. U., 4.5.15). There is also no denial of the manifoldness of modes of the Brahman resulting from His assumption of various names and forms by His will. This is established in Sruti texts such as, 'May I become manifold' (Tai. U., 2.6.1 and Cha. U., 6.2.3) etc. This manifold modality is proved to be existent in the commencement of even that passage which negates multiplicity by asserting. 'But where everything has become the self' (Br. U., 4.5.15). 'Everything deserts Him who knows everything to be apart from Him' (Br. U., 4.5.7), and 'Lo, verily, from this great Being has been breathed forth that which is Rg veda' (Ibid., 2.4.10). Thus there is no contradiction whatsoever among the Srutis which assert difference in essence and in nature between the conscient self, non-conscient matter and the Lord, whose body the former entities are. There is no contradiction also in the scriptural statement that they are identical. The relation of the body and the self exists at all times between the Lord and the conscient and non-conscient entities. The Sruti texts themselves establish that those entities, which constitute the body (of the Lord), acire in causal condition, a subtle state, in which they cannot be differentiated. In the effect condition they are in a gross state with names and forms, and are capable of differentiation into a multiplicity of entities as modes of the Supreme. Thus there is no room whatsoever for entertaining such doctrines which ascribe nescience to Brahman (as in Advaita), for describing the differences in Brahman as due to limiting adjuncts (as in Bhedabheda) and other tenets (Yadavaprakasa's). All these proceed from unsound logic and are in viloation of all Srutis. Let this over-long polemic be terminated here. The object of this long polemical passage is to refute the Advaitic interpretation of the statement Know the Field-Knower in all bodies as Myself' as one of absolute identity between the Jiva and Isvara. The thesis of the author of the commentary is that the relation is not oneof absolute identity but only one of identity of reference of several inseparable entities to a comon substratum known technically as Samandadhikaranya or co-ordinate predication, also translated sometimes as grammatical co-ordination. The literal meaning of the expression is 'the relation of abiding in a common substratum.' The relation of the Jiva and Prakrti to Isvara is as of body and soul or as a mode (Prakara) and its substratum (Prakari). The relation between the body and soul of an ordinary being is, however, separable at death. But it is inseparable in the case of Isvara and this Jiva-cum-Prakrti body. In this sense Isvara is the Field-knower (Ksetrajna) of the Field (Ksetra) constituted of all individual entities conscient and inconscient, just as in each individual personality the Jiva and the body are the field-knower and the field respectively. [Being in co-ordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya), Brahman is an inseparable but mutually distinct complex of Prakrti, Jiva and Isvara. The cosmic mode of body constituted of Prakrti and Purusa is at intervals in alternate states of latency and patency (Pralaya and Srsti or dissolution and manifestation). As the soul of a complex whole, He can be denoed by any of the terms entering into it - Isvara, Prakrti or Jiva. Brahan is sometimes mentioned in the Srutis as Asat when everything is in latency in Pralaya, and as Sat when all entities are in manifestations (Srsti). All these expressions denote Him only. He is described in some texts as attributeless. It means only that He is without any undesriable evil alities. He is on the other hand endowed with countless auspicious attributes. All these contentions are supported by numerous Vedic passages, which are oted in the commentary.]"

      "English": "It is this truth regarding the Kestra and Ksetrajna that has been sung in various ways by Parasara and others seers. For example, 'I and you and others are composed of the elements; and the elements, following the stream of alities, assume a shape; these alities, Sattva and the rest, are dependent on Karma; and Karma, accumulated by nescience, influences the condition of all beings. The self is pure, imperishable, tranil, void of alities and is pre-eminent over Prakrti' (V. P., 2.13.69-71). Similarly: 'The body, characterised by head, hands, feet and the like is different from Purusa.' Which of these can I designate by the name I?' (Ibid., 2.13.89). And also: 'Are you the head or the belly? Are you indeed the feet and other limbs, or do they belong to you, O King? You are distinct in your nature from all your members, O King. Know, O King, and understand \"Who am I\" '. (Ibid., 1.13.102-3). Moreover they state that Vasudeva constitutes the Self of the distinct entities (Ksetra and Ksetrajna): 'The senses, Manas, Buddhi, vigour, splendour, strength, courage, both Ksetra and Ksetrajna have Vasudeva for their self. (Ma. Bha. Sa., 149.136). In various distinctive hymns, namely, in the Vedas, Rg, Yajus, Saman and Atharvan, the distinction of body and the self has been sung. The nature of the body is described in the following text: 'From this Self, verily, ether arose; from the ether, air; from air, fire; from fire, water; from water, the earth; from the earth, herbs; from the herbs, food; from food, the person. The same person, verily, consists of the essence of food' (Tai. U., 2.1.2). Afterwards that which is inner than this (body) and which consists of Prana (or the vital breath), and that which is inner than this and which consists of mind are described. The nature of Ksetrjna is stated in the passage: 'Verily, other than, and within, that one that consists of mind, that (the individual Self) consists of understanding' (Ibid., 2.4.2). Later, the Supreme Brahman is stated in the text; 'Verily, other than, and within, that one consisting of understanding, is the Supreme Self that consists of bliss' (Ibid., 1.5.2). This is stated to be the Surpeme Self, consisting of bliss, as forming the inner Self of the individual self. Similarly in the three Vedas, Rg, Saman and Atharvan, here and there, the distinctive existence of the Ksetra and the Ksetrajna is affirmed with Brahman for their Self. Likewise, the same purpose is taught in the words of the Brahma-sutras, namely, the aphorisms about Brahman, known also as the Sariraka-sutras, which are characterised by reasoning, decision and conclusion. In the Sutras commencing with, 'Not ether, on account of the absence of the Sruti' (B. S., 2.3.1), the nature and the mode of the Ksetra is determined. In the Sutras commencing with 'Not the self, on account of the Sruti and on account of the eternity, (which is made out) from them' (Ibid., 2.3.18), the true nature of the Ksetrajna is determined. In the Sutras 'But from the Supreme, this being declared by Sruti' (Ibid., 2.3.40), that Ksetrajna has the Lord for Its Self on account of Its being under the control of the Lord, is declared. It has been sung in various ways; the meaning of this Sloka is this: Listen about the truths of the Ksetra and the Ksetrajna which have been expounded in numerous ways and declared by Me in a lucid and brief manner."

      "Hindi": "यह दोष नहीं है। क्योंकि हम पहले ही कह चुके हैं कि यह अमानित्वादि सद्गुण ज्ञानके साधन होनेसे और उसके सहकारी कारण होनेसे ज्ञान नामसे कहे गये हैं --, जो जाननेयोग्य है उसको भली प्रकार यथार्थ रूपसे कहूँगा। वह ज्ञेय कैसे फलवाला है यह बात? श्रोतामें रुचि उत्पन्न करके उसे सम्मुख करनेके लिये कहते हैं -- जिस जाननेयोग्य ( परमात्माके स्वरूप ) को जानकर ( मनुष्य ) अमृतको अर्थात् अमरभावको लाभ कर लेता है? फिर नहीं मरता। वह ज्ञेय अनादिमत् है। जिसकी आदि हो वह आदिमत् और जो आदिमत् न हो वह अनादिमत् कहलाता है। वह कौन है वही परम -- निरतिशय ब्रह्म जो कि इस प्रकरणमें ज्ञेयरूपसे वर्णित है। यहाँ कई एक टीकाकार अनादि मत्परम् इस प्रकार पदच्छेद करते हैं। ( कारण यह बतलाते हैं कि ) बहुव्रीहि समासद्वारा बतलाये हुए अर्थमें मतुप् प्रत्ययके प्रयोगकी निरर्थकता है? अतः वह अनिष्ट है। वे ( टीकाकार ऐसा पदच्छेद करके ) अलग अर्थ भी दिखाते हैं कि मैं वासुदेव कृष्ण ही जिसकी परम शक्ति हूँ वह ज्ञेय मत्पर है। ठीक है? यदि उपर्युक्त अर्थ सम्भव होता तो ऐसा पदच्छेद करनेसे पुनरुक्तिके दोषका निवारण हो सकता था? परंतु यह अर्थ ही सम्भव नहीं है क्योंकि यहाँ ब्रह्मका स्वरूप न सत्तन्नासदुच्यते आदि वचनोंसे सर्व विशेषणोंके प्रतिषेधद्वारा ही बतलाना इष्ट है। ज्ञेयको किसी विशेष शक्तिवाला बतलाना और विशेषणोंका प्रतिषेध भी करते जाना यह परस्परविरुद्ध है। सुतरां ( यही समझना चाहिये कि ) मतुप् प्रत्ययका और बहुव्रीहि समासका समान अर्थ होनेपर भी यहाँ श्लोकपूर्तिके लिये यह प्रयोग किया गया है। जिसका फल अमृतत्व है ऐसा ज्ञेय मेरेद्वारा कहा जाता है इस कथनसे रुचि उत्पन्न कर ( अर्जुनको ) सम्मुख करके कहते हैं -- उस ज्ञेयको न सत् कहा जा सकता है और न असत् ही कहा जा सकता है। पू0 -- कटिबद्ध होकर बड़े गम्भीर स्वरसे यह घोषणा करके कि मैं ज्ञेय वस्तुको भली प्रकार बतलाऊँगा फिर यह कहना कि वह न सत् कहा जा सकता है और न असत् ही उस घोषणाके अनुरूप नहीं है। उ0 -- यह नहीं? भगवान्का कहना तो प्रतिज्ञाके अनुरूप ही है क्योंकि वाणीका विषय न होनेके कारण सब उपनिषदोंमें भी ज्ञेय ब्रह्म ऐसा नहीं? ऐसा नहीं स्थूल नहीं? सूक्ष्म नहीं इस प्रकार विशेषोंके प्रतिषेधद्वारा ही लक्ष्य कराया गया है? ऐसा नहीं कहा गया कि वह ज्ञेय अमुक है। पू0 -- जो वस्तु अस्ति शब्दसे नहीं कही जा सकती? वह है भी नहीं। यदि ज्ञेय अस्ति शब्दसे नहीं कहा जा सकता तो वह भी वास्तवमें नहीं है। फिर यह कहना अति विरुद्ध है कि वह ज्ञेय है और अस्ति शब्दसे नहीं कहा जा सकता। उ0 -- वह ( ब्रह्म ) नहीं है? सो नहीं क्योंकि वह नहीं है इस ज्ञानका भी विषय नहीं है। पू0 -- सभी ज्ञान अस्ति या नास्ति इन बुद्धियोंमेंसे ही किसी एकके अनुगत होते हैं। इसलिये ज्ञेय भी या तो अस्ति ज्ञानसे अनुगत प्रतीतिका विषय होगा या नास्ति ज्ञानसे अनुगत प्रतीतिका विषय होगा। उ0 -- यह बात नहीं है। क्योंकि वह ब्रह्म इन्द्रियोंसे अगोचर होनेके कारण दोनों प्रकारके ही ज्ञानयसे अनुगत प्रतीतिका विषय नहीं है। इन्द्रियोंद्वारा जाननेमें आनेवाले जो कोई घट आदि पदार्थ होते हैं? वे ही या तो अस्ति इस ज्ञानसे अनुगत प्रतीतिके या अस्ति इस ज्ञानसे अनुगत प्रतीतिके विषय होते हैं। परंतु यह ज्ञेय ( ब्रह्म ) इन्द्रियातीत होनेके कारण? केवल एक शब्दप्रमाणसे ही प्रमाणित हो सकता है?,इसलिये घट आदि पदार्थोंकी भाँति यह है नहीं है इन दोनों प्रकारके ही ज्ञानोंके अनुगत प्रतीतिका विषय नहीं है? सुतरां वह न तो सत् कहा जा सकता है और न असत् ही कहा जा सकता है। तथा तुमने जो यह कहा कि ज्ञेय है किंतु वह न सत् कहा जाता है और न असत् कहा जाता है? यह कहना विरुद्ध है? सो विरुद्ध नहीं है क्योंकि वह ब्रह्म जाने हुएसे और न जाने हुएसे भी अन्य है इस श्रुतिप्रमाणसे यह बात सिद्ध है। पू0 -- यदि यह श्रुति भी विरुद्ध अर्थवाली हो तो अर्थात् जैसे यज्ञके लिये यज्ञशाला बनानेका विधान करके वहाँ कहा है कि उस बातको कौन जानता है कि परलोकमें यह सब है या नहीं इस श्रुतिके समान यह श्रुति भी विरुद्धार्थयुक्त हो तो उ0 -- यह बात नहीं है क्योंकि यह जाने हुएसे और न जाने हुएसे विलक्षणत्व प्रतिपादन करनेवाली श्रुति निस्सन्देह अवश्य ही ज्ञेय पदार्थका होना प्रतिपादन करनेवाली है और यह सब परलोकमें है या नहीं इत्यादि श्रुतिवाक्य विधिके अन्तका अर्थवाद है ( अतः उसके साथ इसकी समानता नहीं हो सकती )। युक्तिसे भी यह बात सिद्ध है कि ब्रह्म सत्असत् आदि शब्दोंद्वारा नहीं कहा जा सकता क्योंकि अर्थका प्रकाश करनेके लिये वक्ताद्वारा बोले जानेवाले और श्रोताद्वारा सुने जानेवाले सभी शब्द जाति? क्रिया? गुण और सम्बन्धद्वारा संकेत ग्रहण करवाकर ही अर्थकी प्रतीति कराते हैं? अन्य प्रकारसे नहीं। कारण? अन्य प्रकारसे प्रतीति होती नहीं देखी जाती। जैसे गौ या घोड़ा यह जातिसे? पकाना या पढ़ना यह क्रियासे? सफेद या काला यह गुणसे और धनवान् या गौओंवाला यह सम्बन्धसे ( जाने जाते हैं। इसी तरह सबका ज्ञान होता है )। परंतु ब्रह्म जातिवाला नहीं है? इसलिये सत् आदि शब्दोंद्वारा नहीं कहा जा सकता निर्गुण होनेके कारण वह गुणवान् भी नहीं है? जिससे कि गुणवाचक शब्दोंसे कहा जा सके और क्रियारहित होनेके कारण क्रियावाचक शब्दोंसे भी नहीं कहा जा सकता। ब्रह्म कलारहित? क्रियारहित और शान्त है इस श्रुतिसे भी यही बात सिद्ध होती है। तथा एक? अद्वितीय? इन्द्रियोंका अविषय और आत्मरूप होनेके कारण ( वह ब्रह्म ) किसीका सम्बन्धी भी नहीं है। अतः यह कहना उचित ही है कि ब्रह्म किसी भी शब्दसे नहीं कहा जा सकता। जहाँसे वाणी निवृत्त हो जाती है इत्यादि श्रुतिप्रमाणोंसे भी यही बात सिद्ध होती है।",
      "English": "Pravaksyami, I shall speak of, fully describe just as it is; tat, that; yat, which; is jenyam, to be known. In order to interest the hearer through inducement, the Lord speaks of what its result is: Jnatva, by realizing; yat, which Knowable; asnute, one attains; amrtam, Immortality, i.e.; he does not die again. Anadimat, without beginning-one having a beginning (adi) is adimat; one not having a beginning is anadimat. What is that? The param, supreme, unsurpassable; brahma, Brahman, which is under discussion as the Knowable. Here, some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because, if the word anadimat is taken as a Bahuvrihi compound, ['That which has no (a), beginning (adi) is anadi.' Matup is used to denote possession. Since the idea of possession is a already implied in anadi, therefore matup, if added after it, becomes redundant.] then the suffix mat (matup) becomes redundant, which is undesirable. And they show a distintive meaning: (Brahman is anadi, beginningless, and is) matparam, that of which I am the supreme (para) power called Vasudeva. Trully, the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig were possible. But that meaning is not possible, because what is intended is to make Brahman known only through a negation of all attributes by saying, 'It is called neither being nor non-being.' It is contradictory to show a possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes. Therefore, although matup and a bahuvrihi compound convey the same meaning of 'possession', its (matup's) use is for completing the verse. [The Commentator accepts anadimat as a nan-tatpurusa compund. If, however, the Bahuvrihi is insisted on, then the mat after anadi should be taken as completing the number of syllables needed for versification. So, nat need not be compounded with param.] Having aroused an interest through inducement by saying, 'The Knowable which has Immortality as its result is beeing spoken of by Me,' the Lord says: Tat, that Knowable; ucyate, is called; na sat, neither being; nor is it called asat, non-being. Objection: After strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice, 'I shall speak of the Knowable,' is it not incongruous to say, 'That is called neither being nor non-being'? Reply: No. What has been said is surely consistent. Objection: How? Reply: For in all the Upanisads, the Knowable, i.e. Brahman, has been indicated only by negation of all attributes-'Not this, not this' (Br. 4.4.22), 'Not gross, not subtle' (op. cit. 3.3.8), etc.; but not as 'That is this', for It is beyond speech. Objection: Is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word 'being' does not exist? Like-wise, if the Knowable cannot be expressed by the word 'being', It does not exist. And it is contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable', and 'It cannot be expressed by the word \"being\".' Counter-objection: As to that, no that It does not exist, because It is not the object of the idea, 'It is non-being.' Objection: Do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or non-being? This being so, the Knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence, or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of non-existence. Reply: No, because, by virtue of Its being super-sensuous, It is not an object of cognition involving either, of the two ideas. Indeed, any object perceivable by the senses, such as pot etc., can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence, or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of non-existence. But this Knowable, being supersensuous and known from the scriptures, which are the sole means of (Its) knowledge, is not, like pot etc., an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas. Therefore It is called neither being nor non-being. As for your objection that it is contradictory to say, 'It is the Knowable, but it is neither called being nor non-being,'-it is not contradictory; for the Upanisad says, 'That (Brahman) is surely different from the known and, again, It is above the unknown' (Ke. 1.4). Objection: May it not be that even the Upanisad is contradictory in its meaning? May it not be (contradictory) as it is when, after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice, [Cf. 'Pracinavamsam karoti, he constructs (i.e. shall construct) (the sacrificial shed) with its supporting beam turned east-ward' (Tai, Sam.; also see Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Monier Williams).-Tr.] it is said, 'Who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not!' (Tai. Sam. 6.1.1)? Reply: No, since the Upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized. [The Upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical, for it is meant to present Brahman as indentical with one's own inmost Self.] But, '৷৷.whether there exists anything in the other world,' etc. is merely an arthavada [See note on p. 40. Here, the passage, '৷৷.whether there exists৷৷.,' etc. is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing, the need of raising a shed, irrespective of any other consideration.-Tr.] connected with an injunction. From reason who it follows that Brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being, non-being, etc. For, every word used for expressing an object, when heard by listeners, makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus, action, ality and relation; not in any other way, because that is not a matter of experience. To illustrate this: a cow, or a horse, etc. (is comprehended) through genus; cooking or reading, through action; white or black, through ality; a rich person or an owner of cows, through relation. But Brahman does not belong to any genus. Hence it is not expressible by words like 'being' etc.; neither is It possessed of any alitity with the help of which It could be expressed through alifying words, for It is free from alities; nor can It be expressed by a word implying action, It being free from actions-which accords with the Upanisadic text, 'Partless, actionless, calm' (Sv. 6.19). Nor has It any relation, since It is one, non-dual, not an object of the senses, and It is the Self. Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, 'From which, words trun back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc. Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word. And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as, 'From which, words turn back' (Tai. 2.4.1), etc. Since the Knowable (Brahman) is not an object of the word or thought of 'being', there arises the apprehension of Its nonexistence. Hence, for dispelling that apprehension by establishing Its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures, the Lord says:"

      "English": " I shall declare that nature of the individual self (brahman) which is the object to be known, namely, what is to be gained by means of virtues like modesty etc., by knowing which one attains to the self which is immortal, birthless, free from old age, death and such other material alities. [The expression is split up as - Anadi = beginningless; Mat-param = having Me as the Highest.] Anadi means that which is beginningless. Indeed, there is no origination for this individual self (brahman) and for the same reason, It is endless. The Sruti also declares: 'The wise one is not born, nor dies' (Ka. U., 2.18). 'Matpara' means having Me for the Highest. Verily, it has been told: 'Know that which is other than this (lower nature), which is the life-principle, to be the highest Prakrti of Mine' (7.5). By virtue of being the body of the Lord, the nature of the self finds joy in being completely subsidiary to Him. So the Sruti declares: 'He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self, whom the self does not know, whose body the self is and who controls the self from within ৷৷.' (Br. U. Madh., 5.7.22). Similarly do the texts declare: 'He is the cause, Lord of Lords and of sense organs. He has no progenitor, nor lord' (Sve. U., 6.9); and 'He is the Lord of the Pradhana and of the individual selves, and the Lord of alities (Ibid., 6.16). That which is conjoined with the ality of infinite dimension or extensiveness can be designated as brahman. It is different from, and not circumscribable by, the body etc. The meaning is, It is the principle which apprehends the Ksetra. Sruti also declares: 'He (i.e., the individual self) partakes of infinity' (Sve. U., 5.9). By its Karma It is circumscribed. It assumes Its infinite nature only when It is freed from the bonds of Karma. The term brahman is applied to designate the individual self as in: 'He, crossing beyond the Gunas', becomes fit for the sake of brahman' (14.26), 'I am the ground of the brahman, who is immutable and immortal' (14.27), and 'Having attained to the state of brahman, tranil, he neither grieves nor craves; regarding all beings alike, he attains supreme devotion to Me' (18.54). It (brahman) is said to be neither being nor non-being. The terms 'being' and 'non-being' cannot signify the nature of the self because It is neither effect nor cause. For It is called 'being' (Sat) in the condition of effect when It has the form of gods etc. As It cannot possess names and forms in the condition of cause, It is said to be 'non-being' or Asat. So the Sruti texts declare: 'In the beginning, verily, this (brahman) was non-existence; therefrom the being was born' (Tai. U., 2.7.1) and 'Verily, this (brahman) was then undifferntiated. It became differentiated by names and forms' (Br. U., 1.4.7). The self's conditions as effect and cause have arisen on account of veiling by Avidya or ignorant in the form of Karma. It is not an expression of Its real nature. So, the terms 'being' and 'non-being' do not signify the nature of the self, If it is argued that, in the passage 'In the beginning, verily, this (Brahman) was non-existence' (Tai. U., 2.7.1), it is the Supreme Brahman in the state of cause that is described - even then it can be pointed out that the Supreme Brahman in causal condition has, for His body, the conscient and non-conscient entities in a subtle state, incapable of being differentiated by names and forms. Such a description is therefore valid. On the same principle the nature of Ksetra (body) and Ksetrajna (individual self) in the state of cause can also be indicated by the term 'non-being'. But this condition of the individual self has arisen due to Karma and such descriptions as 'being' and 'non-being' are applicable to the self only in the state of bondage. Its pure form cannot be signified by the terms 'being' and 'non-being'."

Hence, by denying it, the nature of the Knowable has been stated, in, 'That is called neither being nor non-being.' Although the unreal form is caused by the limiting adjuncts, still, for the comprehension of Its existence it is said, '(It) has hands and feet everywhere, etc., by assuming this as a ality of the Knowable. Thus, as is well known, there is saying of the people versed in tradition, 'The Transcendental is described with the help of superimposition and its refutation'. Everywhere the hands, feet, etc., which are perceived as limbs of all bodies, perform, their duties due to the presence of the power of the Knowable (Brahman). Thus the grounds for the inference of the existence of the Knowable are metaphorically spoken of as belonging to the Knowable. The others have to be explained similarly. That Knowable has hands and feet everwhere. That which has eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere is sarvatoksi-siro-mukham. That which has ears every-where is sarvatah-srutimat: sruti means the organs of hearing; that which has it is sruti-mat.

      "English": "Everywhere are Its hands and feet i.e., the self in Its pure form is able to perform everywhere the works of hands and feet.

If 'Brahman' is taken to mean the self, it can be asked how this power of the Supreme Brahman (namely, having hand, feet, eyes, etc., everywhere) can be attributed to the self, then the answer is that it is established in the Srutis that the pure individual self has the capacity of performing the task of hands, feet etc., because It is eal to Him. Sruti also declares: 'Then, the wise seer, shaking off good and evil, stainless, attains the supreme eality with Him' (Mun. U., 3.1.3).

      "English": "Sarvendriya-guna-abhasam, shining through the functions of all the organs: By the use of the words all the organs are understood ears etc., known as the sense-organs and motor-organs, as also the internal organs-the intellect and the mind, for they are eally the limiting adjuncts of the Knowable. Besides, the organs of hearing etc. become the limiting adjuncts from the very fact of the internal organ becoming so. Hence, the Knowable gets expressed through determination, thinking, hearing, speaking, etc. that are the functions of all the organs, internal and external, which are the limiting adjuncts. In this way, It is manifest through the functions of all the organs. The idea is that, that Knowable appears to be as though active owing to the functions of all the organs, as it is said in the Upanisadic text, 'It thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7). For that reason, again, is It not perceived as being actually active? In answer the Lord says: It is sarva-indriya-varjitam, devoid of all the organs, i.e. bereft of all the instruments of action. Hence the Knowable is not active through the functioning of the instruments of action. As for the Upanisadic verse, 'Without hands and feet He moves swiftly and grasps; without eyes He sees, without ears He hears' (Sv. 3.19), etc.-that is meant for showing that that Knowable has the power of adapting Itself to the functions of all the organs which are Its limiting adjuncts; but it is not meant to show that It really has such activity as moving fast etc. The meaning of that verse is like that of the Vedic text, 'The blind one discoverd a gem' (Tai, Ar. 1.11). [This is an artha-veda (see note on p.530), which is not to be taken literally but interpreted in accordance with the context.] Since the Knowable is devoid of all the instruments of actions, therefore It is asaktam, unattached, devoid of all associations. Although It is of this kind, yet it is ca eva, also verily; the sarva-bhrt, supporter of all. Indeed, everything has existence as its basis, because the idea of 'existence' is present everywhere. Verily, even mirage etc. do not occur without some basis. Therefore, It is sarva-bhrt, the supporter of all-It upholds everything. There can be this other organs as well for the realization of the existence of the Knowable: Nirgunam, without ality-the alities are sattva, rajas and tamas; that Knowable is free from them; and yet It is the guna-bhoktr, perceiver of alities; i.e., that Knowable is the enjoyer and experiencer of the alities, sattva, rajas and tamas, which, assuming the forms of sound etc., transform them-selves into happiness, sorrow, delusion, etc. Further,"

For God's god-hood consists verily in having the two aspects.

      "English": "Karya-karana-kartrtve, with regard to the source of body and organs: Karya is the body, and karana are the thirteen [Five sense organs, five motor organs, mind, intellect and ego.] organs existing in it. Here, by the word karya are understood the aforesaid elements that produce the body as also the objects which are modifications born of Nature. And since the alities-which are born of Nature and manifest themselves as happiness, sorrow and delusion-are dependent on the organs, (therefore) they are implied by the word karana, organs. The kartrtvam, (lit) agentship, with regard to these body and organs consists in being the source of the body and organs. With regard to this source of the body and organs, prakrtih, Nature; ucyate, is said to be; the hetuh, cause, in the sense of being the originator. Thus, by virtue of being the source of body and organs, Nature is the cause of mundane existence. Even if the reading be karya-karana-kartrtva, karya (effect, modification) will mean anything that is the transformation of something; and karana (cause) will be that which becomes transformed. So the meaning of the compund will be: 'with regard to the source of the effect and the cause'. Or, karya means the sixteen [The eleven organs (five sensory, five motor, and mind) and the five objects (sound etc.).] modificaitons, and karana means the seven [Mahat, egoism, and the five subtle elements.] transformations of Nature. They themselves are called effect and cuase. So far as the agentship with regard to these is concerned Nature is said to be the cause, because of the same reason of being their originator. As to how the soul can be the cause of mundane existence is being stated: Purusah, the soul, the empirical being, the knower of the field-all these are synonymous; is the hetuh, cause; bhoktrtve, so far as enjoyership, the fact of being the perceiver; sukha-duhkhanam, of happiness and sorrow-which are objects of experience, is concerned. How, again, is it asserted with respect to Nature and soul that, they are the causes of mundane existence by virtue of this fact of their (respectively) being the source of body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow? As to this the answer is being stated: How can there be any mundane existence if there be no modification of Nature in the form of body and organs, happiness and sorrow, and cause and effect, and there be no soul, the conscious being, to experience them? On the other hand, there can be mundane existence when there is a contact, in the form of ignorance, between Nature-modified in the form of body and organs, and cause and effect as an object of experience and the soul opposed to it as the experiencer. Therefore it was reasonable to have said that, Nature and soul become the cause of mundane existence by (respectively) becoming the originators of the body and organs, and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow. What again is this that is called worldly existence? Worldly existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow; and the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow. It has been asserted that the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow. How does it come about? This is being answered:"

      "English": "The 'Karya' means the body, the 'Karanas' mean the instruments, i.e., the senses of perception and action plus the Manas. In their operations, the Prakrti, subservient to the self, is alone the causal factor. The sense is that their operations, which are the means of experience, have their foundation in the Prakrti, which has developed in the form of the body subservient to the self. In regard to this, the authority is the aphorism, 'The self is an agent, on account of the scriptures having the purpose' (B. S., 2.3.33) etc. The agency of the self means that the self is the cause of the will (effort) to support the body. The self (Purusa) associated with the body is the cause for experiencing pleasures and pains. The meaning is that It is the seat of those experiences. Thus, has been explained the difference in the operations of the Prakrti and of the self when they are mutually conjoined. He now proceeds to explain how, though the self, which in Its pristine nature experiences Itself by Itself as nothing but joy, becomes the cause of experiencing both pleasure and pain derived from sense objects when It is conjoined with a body. The term Guna figuratively represents effects. The self (in Its pristine nature) experiences Itself by Itself, as nothing buy joy. But when dwelling in the body, i.e., when It is in conjunction with the Prakrti, It experiences the alities born of Prakrti, namely, happiness, pain etc., which are the effects of Gunas like Sattva etc. He explains the cause of conjunction with the Prakrti:"

      "English": "Hi, since; purusah, the soul, the experiencer; is prakrtisthah, seated in Nature, which is characterized as ignorance and gets transformed into body and organs, i.e., (since the soul) has become identified with Nature; therefore, bhunkte, [Bhunkte, lit. enjoys, here means 'experiences'.-Tr.] it enjoys, i.e. experiences; gunan, the alities-manifest as happiness, sorrow and delusion; prakrtijan, born of Nature, thinking thus, 'I am happy, sorrowful, deluded, learned.' Even though ignorance continues as a cause, still the main cause of worldly existence, of birth, is the contact, the self-identification, with the alities-happiness,sorrow, and delusion-when they are experienced, as is affirmed by the Upanisadic text, 'What it desires, it resolves' (Br. 4.4.5) [See Sankaracarya's Comm. on this.-Tr.]. That very fact is stated here: Gunasangah, contact with the alities; is karanam, the cause; asya, of its, the soul's, the experiencer's; sad-asad-yoni-janmasu, births in good and evil wombs. Self-identification with the alities is the cause of the experience of births in good and evil wombs. Or the meaning is, 'Self-identification with the alities is the cause or its worldly existence through birth in good and evil wombs,' where the words 'of worldly existence' have to be supplied. The good wombs are he wombs of gods and others; evil wombs are the wombs of gods and others; evil wombs are the wombs of beasts etc. From the force of the context it is to be understood that there is no contradiction in including even human wombs among 'good and evil wombs'. It amounts to saying that ignorance-called 'being seated in Nature'-and the contact with. i.e. the desire for, the alities are the causes of worldly existence. And this is said so that they can be avoided. And in the scripture Gita it is a well-known fact that knowledge and dispassion, accompanied with renunciation, are the causes of removing this (ignorance and self-identification with the alities). That knowledge about the field and the Knower of the field, too, has been presented earlier. This has also been said in, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains Immortality' (12), etc., through the process of refutation of elements alien (to the Self) and superimposition of alities belonging to others (that are not the Self). [Verse 12 deals with the refutation of alien elements, and vere 13 with the superimposition of alities belonging to others.] A direct presentation is again being made of that (knowledge) itself:"

Then It becomes active and conseently is born again as a result of Its activities. As long as It does not cultivate alities like modesty etc., which are the means for realising the self, so long Its entanglement in Samsara continues like this.

Or: The observers are the body, eyes, mind, intellect and the soul. Of them the body is the external observer. Proceeding inwards from that (body), the Self is the inmost as also the proximate observer, compared with which there is no other higher and inner observer.

And He is the anu-manta, Permitter: Anumananam, approval, means satisfaction with those performers (viz body and organs) as also their perfomances. The agent of that (approval) is the anumanta. Or, He is the anumanta since, even though Himself not engaged in the activities of the body and organs, He appears to be favourably disposed towards and engaged in them. Or, He is the anumanta because, when the body and organs are engaged in their own functions, He remains as a witness and never dissuades them. It is the bharta, Sustainer: Bharanam means the continuance in their own state of the body, organs, mind and intellect, which reflect consciousness and have become aggregated owing to the need of serving the purpose [Viz enjoyment, or Liberation.-Tr.] of some other entity, viz the conscious Self. And that (continuance) is verily due to the consciousness that is the Self. In this sense the Self is said to be the Sustainer.

In this sense the Self is said to be the Experiencer. He is maheswarah, the great God, because, as the Self of all and independent, He is the great Ruler. He is paramatma, the transcendental Self, because He is the Self which has the characteristics of being the supreme Witness etc. of (all) those-beginning from the body and ending with the intellect-which are imagined through ignorance to be the indwelling Self.

From the word api it is understood that, it goes without saying that one who is firm in his own duty is not rorn. Objection: Though it has been said that there is absence of rirth after the dawn of Knowledge, still is not illogical that actions done (in the present life) before the rise of Knowledge and those done subseently, as also those done in the many past lives, should be destroyed without yielding their results? Hence there should be three births! For destruction of acired merit is not logical, to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth and are yielding their proper results (cannot be destroyed). Besides, it is not understood that actions have distinctions [Since all actions arise from ignorance, they are on the same level so far so they are opposed to Knowledge; i.e., there can be no such distinction among actions as 'those which have started yielding results' and 'those that have not'.]. Therefore, the actions of the three kinds, without exception, will produce three births or they all collectively will produce one birth. Otherwise, if the acired merits become destroyed, it will lead to loss of faith everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures. Therefore it has been illogical to say, 'he will not be born again.' Reply: No, for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of Upanisadic texts such as: 'And all one's actions become dissipated' (Mu. 2.2.8); 'Anyone who knows (that supreme) Brahman, becomes Brahman' (op. cit. 3.2.9); 'For him the delay is for so long only (as he does not become freed)' (Ch. 6.14.2); 'As the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed (become completely burnt৷৷.,' so) all actions 'get completely burnt' (op. cit. 5.24.3). Here too the burning of all actions has been stated in, 'as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes,৷৷.'etc. (4.37), and He will also say so (later) [See 18.66: 'I shall free you from all sins,' etc.-Tr.]. This accords with reason also. Verily, actions, which arise from the seed of evils [Klesas, evils-see note under 8.19-Tr.] like ignorance and desires, germinate the sprout of rirth. Here also it has been said by the Lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits, not the others. And there is also the verse: 'As seeds burnt by fire do not germinate, so also the Self does not acire another body due to evils that have been burnt by Knowledge (cf. Mbh. Va. 199. 107). Objection: It may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of Knowledge are burnt by Knowledge, since they coexist with Knowledge. But the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise of Knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable. Reply: No, because of the alification, 'all actions' (4.37). Objection: May it not be that 'all actions' means those that are undertaken after Illumination? Reply: No, for there is no reason for the restriction (of the meaning). On the other hand, as for the statement, 'just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get dissipated even after Illumination, similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing their results should get dissipated,'-that is wrong. Objection: Why? Reply: Since they have already begun producing results, like an arrow that has been shot: As an arrow, freed earlier from a bow for hitting a target, even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum, similarly, actions that produced the (present) body verily continue, even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body, to exist as before until the dissipation of their inherent tendencies. But, as that very arrow, when it has not acired the momentum, needed for action, when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow, can be withdrawn, similarly, actions which have not begun yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by Knowledge, even while existing in their receptacle. [The internal organ bearing the reflection of Consciousness.] Hence, it is established that , it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person, 'He is not born again.' Here are being presented these meditation etc. which are the alternative means for the realization of the Self:"

Thus, from the citation of such illustrations as, 'the crane meditates, as it were, 'the earth meditates, as it were; the mountains meditate, as it were' (Ch. 7.6.1), it follows that meditation is a constant and uninterrupted current of thought like a line of pouring oil.

Since the Knower of the field is partless like space, therefore Its conjunction with the field cannot be a kind of relationship like coming together of a rope and a pot through the contact of their parts. Nor can it be an intimate and inseparable relation as between a thread and a cloth, since it is not admitted that the field and the Knower of the field are mutually related by way of being cause and effect. Reply: The answer is: The association of the field and the Knower of the field-which are the object and the subject, respectively, and are of different natures-is in the form of superimposition of each on the other an also of their alities, as a conseence of the absence of discrimination between the real natures of the field and the Knower of the field. This is like the association of a rope, nacre, etc. with the superimposed snake, silver, etc. owing to the absence of discrimination between them. This association of the field and the Knower of the field in the form of superimposition is described as false knowledge.

Since the cause of his rirth has been eliminated. therefore what was said in, 'He who knows thus the Person and Nature along with the alities৷৷.', that the man of realization is not born again (23), has been a reasonable statement. In 'He৷৷.will not be born again' (23) has been stated the result of right knowledge, which is the absence of birth owing to the destruction of ignorance etc., the seeds of worldly existence. The cause of birth, viz the association of the field and the Knower of the field brought about by ignorance, has also been stated.

For, all the modifications [See note 3 on p.38.-Tr.] of an existing thing have as their root that modification of an existing thing described as birth. All other modifications of existing things that follow birth end with destruction. After destruction there is no modification of an existing thing, because the object itself becomes nonexistent. Indeed, alities can exist so long as the thing alified exists. Therefore, by the reiteration of the absence of the last modification of an existing thing, all its preceding modifications become negated along with their effects. Hence it is established that the supreme Lord is very greatly different from all beings, and is also Unconditioned [Free from all modifications that things are subject to.] and One. He sees who thus sees the supreme Lord as described. Objection: Is it not that all poeple see? What is the need of specification? Reply: True, they see; but they see contrarily! Hence the Lord specifies, 'He alone sees'. As in comparison with one who, suffering from the (eye) disease called Timira, sees many moons, the person who sees one moon is distingusihed by saying, 'He alone sees,' similarly, here as well, the man who sees the one undivided Self as described above is distinguished from those who contrarily see many and differentiated selves, by saying 'He alone sees'. Others, though seeing, do not see because they see contrarily like the person who sees many moons. This is the meaning. The obove-described true knowledge has to be praised by stating its result. Hence the verse begins:"

Objection: Is it not that no creature whatsoever injures himself by himself? Why do you refer to an irrelevant thing by saying, 'He does not injure৷৷.,which is like saying, 'Fire should neither be lit on the earth nor in the sky,' etc.? Reply: This defect does not arise, because it is logical with reference to an unenlightened person's ignoring the Self. For, all unillumined people ignore the very wellknown Self which is manifest and directly perceptible, and regard the non-Self as the Self. By performing righteous and unrighteous acts they destroy even that self which has been accepted, and adopt another new self. And destroying even that, they take up another. Similarly, destroying even that, they adopt another. In this way they destroy the self that had been accepted successively. Thus, all unillumined persons are destroyers of the Self. But that which is the Self in reality, even that remains as though destroyed for ever by ignorance, because of the absence of any benefit from Its presence. So, all unenlightened persons are, verily, destroyers of the Self. On the contrary, the other person who has realized the Self as described does not injure in either way [i.e. either through superimposition or through non-super-imposition.] the Self by his own Self. Therefore he attains the supreme Goal, i.e., the result stated above comes to him. Lest it be doubted that what was said in, 'seeing eally God who is present in all beings, he does not injure the Self by the Self, is improper with regard to the selves which are diverse according to the differences created by the variety in their own alities and actions, the Lord says:"

So also, nirgunatvat, being without alities: indeed, It si only something possessing alities that perishes owing to the losss of its alities. But this One, being without alities, does not perish. Hence, ayam, this; paramatma, supreme Self; is avyayah, immutable. It suffers no depletion. Therefore It is immutable. Since this is so, therefore, api, although; sarira-sthah, existing in the body-since the perception of the Self occurs in the bodies, It is said to be 'existing in the body'; even then, It na, does not; karoti, act.

Hence It is not affected by any result. This is the meaning. Objection: Who is it, again, that acts in the body and becomes affected? On the one hand, if there be some embodied being other than the supreme Self who acts and becomes affected, then it has been improper to say in, 'And also understand Me to be the Knower of the field,' etc., that the Knower of the field and God are one. Again, if there be no embodied being who is different from God, then it has to be stated who is it that acts and gets affected. Or it has to be asserted that the supreme One does not exist. [If the supreme One also acts like us, then He is no God.] Thus, since the Upanisadic philosophy as stated by the Lord is in every way difficult to understand and difficult to explain, it has therefore been abandoned by the Vaisesikas, the Sankhyas, the Jainas and the Buddhists. Reply: As to that, the following refutation has been stated by the Lord Himself in, 'But it is Nature that acts' (5.14). Indeed, Nature, which is nothing but ignorance, acts and becomes affected. In this way empirical dealing becomes possible; but in reality it does not occur in the one supreme Self. It has been accordingly shown by the Lord in various places that there is no duty to be performed by those who adhere to this philosophy of discriminating knowledge of the supreme Reality, who are steadfast in Knowledge, who have spurned actions arising out of ignorance, and who are mendicants belonging to the highest Order of monks.

They, through the knowledge already imparted concerning the differences between the body and the self, know those differences existing between them. Then learning about modesty etc., which form the means of deliverance from Prakrti that has devleoped into material elements constituting the body, they have to practise these virtues, and they will thery be absolutely delivered from bondage and will reach the self marked by infinite knowledge abiding in Its own form."

Bringing about the association of happiness, which is the object, with the Self, which is the subject, in the form of the idea, 'I am happy', is certainly an unreal contact with happiness.

And it has been said by the Lord that all the alities, from 'desire' to 'fortitude' (see 13.6), are, indeed, of the field, which is the object. Therefore, it is certainly through nescience, which is an attribute [In reality, though nescience has no connection with the Self, yet, since there is none other with which it can become associated and since it has no independence, therefore the Commentator imagines it as an attribute of the Self.] of the Self and has the characteristics of non-discrimination between object and subject, that sattva apparently brings about the association with happiness, which is not the Self.

Were it an attribute [If knowledge were a natural attribute of the Self, then there can be no estion of the latter again becoming bound through association with the former.] of the Self, there could be no contact (between it and the Self), and 'bondage' would become illogical.

What is called purity is to be bereft of alities which veil light and happiness. Because its nature is solely the generation of light and happiness, it constitutes the cause of light and happiness. 'Light' or illumination is enlightenment about a thing as it is. It is 'not morbid,' i.e., an effect called morbidity (disease) does not exist in its presence. The meaning is, that Sattva is the cause of health. The Guna, called Sattva, however, binds the self by attachment to happiness and knowledge. The meaning is that it causes attachment to happiness and knowledge. When attachment to knowledge and happiness is born, one engages oneself in secular and Vedic means for securing them. Conseently, one is born in such bodies which constitute the means for realising such fruits. Hence the Sattva binds the self through attachment to happiness and knowledge.

And Tamas springs from knowledge contrary to the true nature of thinngs. It deludes all embodied selves. Delusion is erroneous knowledge. The meaning is that Tamas is the cause of erroneous knowledge. Being the cause of negligence, indolence and sleep, it binds the embodied self through them. 'Negligence' is inattentiveness, which causes one to perform works other than what ought to be done. 'Indolence' is the tendency to avoid work; it may even develop into absolute inaction. 'Sleep.' is the state in which the external organs stop working due to exhaustion and seek to recover from the same. In sleep when only the outgoing actionof the senses stop, it is called dream state. When even the mind (Manas) ceases to function, it is called dreamless sleep.

      "English": "Thus, in the manner explained, those who 'rest in Sattva rise upwards,' namely, they attain liberation from the bonds of Samsara gradually. Those who, 'abiding in Rajas' which produces greed for heaven etc., engage themselves in actions which constitute the means for obtaining such results. Experiencing those results, they are born again and engage in, and perform, the very same acts. So they remain in the 'middle'. This is mostly suffering, as it is characterised by rirths. Those of Tamasic nature 'stoop down' into lower levels, as Tamas grows ever worse in them. They go 'downwards' i.e., to the lowest state among human beings, then to the condition of animals; then to that of worms; insects etc., then of immovable things, and even to the condition of shrubs and creepers, and ultimately to the condition of stones, wood, clod of earth, straw etc. Sri Krsna now teaches about the manner of those in whom the Sattva has gradually increased by adopting special holy food and performance of special disinterested deeds, and who thus rise upward by transcending the Gunas."

I, being of such nature, devotion to Me helps the Jiva to transcend the Gunas. Although the expression 'eternal Dharma' is indicative of the conduct to be observed, in the given context, it means the goal to be attained; for, what follows and what precedes it, denote the goal and not conduct.

The Tree of the World which is such, is urdhva-mulam. This accords with the Upanisadic text, 'This has its roots above and branches below' (Ka. 2.6.1). In the Purana also we have: It sprouts from the Root in the form of the Unmanifest; it grows through the sturdiness of that very One. And it has abundance of intelligence as its trunk, and the appertures of the organs as the hollows. The great elements are its boughs [A.G. takes the word visakha (boughs) in the sense of stambha, perhaps meaning the aerial roots.-Tr.]; so also, it has the objects of perception as its leaves. It has virtue and vice as its beautiful flowers, and happiness and sorrow are the fruits it bears. This eternal Tree presided over by Brahman is a means of livelihood to all creatures. And this verily is the resort of Brahman [Or, etat brahma-vanam means: This Tree has Brahman as its object of adoration, its support. For, the world has nothing but Brahman as its support.] in it Brahman dwells for ever. Having felled and split this Tree with the great sword of Knowledge, and then attaining the bliss of the Self, one does not return from that (bliss).' (Cf. Mbh. As. 47.12-15.) That Tree which has its roots upwards and is constituted by the enchantment of mundane existence, and adhah-sakham, which has the branches downwards-mahat, [See under 7.4.-Tr.] egoism, subtle elements, etc. are its branches (sakhah), as it were, extending downwards (adhah); so, it has its branches downwards-; that Tree with its branches downwards, which does not (a) last (stha) even for the morrow (svah), is asvatthah (lit. Peepul tree). Ahuh, they say; that the asvatthah, Peepul Tree, undergoing destruction every moment; is avyayam, imperishable, and constituted by the enchantments of mundane existence. Having been in existence from time without beginning, that Tree of the World is imperishable. It is, indeed, will known as the sustainer of the beginningless and ceaseless series of bodies etc. They call that the imperishable. Of that very Tree of the World here is another alification: Yasya, that Tree of the World of which; chandamsi-chandas being derived in the sense of covering (protecting)-, the Vedas in the form of Rk, Yajus and Sama; are the parnani, leaves, as it were. As leaves serve as protectors of a tree, so the Vedas serve as the protectors of the world; for they reveal what are virtue and vice as also their causes and results. Yah, he who; veda, knows; tam, that-the Tree of the World along with its root, as has been explained; sah, he; is a vedavit, knower of the Vedas, i.e. versed in the meaning of the Vedas. Since, apart from this Tree of the World along with its root, not even an iota of any other thing remains to be known, therefore he who knows the purport of the Vedas is omniscient. In this way the Lord euligizes the knowledge of the Tree together with its root. An imagery of the other parts of that very Tree of the World is being presented:"

U., 6.1), and 'He who knows the tree with its roots above and branches below' (Tai. A., 1.11.5). It has its roots above since it has its roots in Brahma (the Creator otherwise known as Hiranyagarbha) who is seated above the seven worlds. It has 'branches below' ending with denizens like men, animals, beasts, worms, insects, birds and immovables. It is 'immutable' since it cannot be felled, being of the form of a continual flow. It can be felled only at the dawn of perfect knowledge which causes detachment. They say that the leaves of this Asvattha tree constitute the Vedas. 'The Vedas are said to be the leaves', since this tree of Samsara increases by actions prompted by worldly desires as taught in certain Srutis as, 'He who desires prosperity should sacrifice a white animal to Vayu' (Taitt. Sam., 2.1.1) and 'The desirer of offspring shall offer to Indra and Agni a sacrifice with eleven cups of rice-cakes' (Ibid., 2.2.1). Indeed the tree flourishes with the help of leaves. He who knows the Asvattha of such a nature 'knows the Vedas'. The Vedas also set forth the means of felling this tree of Samsara. He who understands this is called the knower of the Vedas, since knowledge of the nature of the tree to be cut off is helpful to the knowledge concerning the means of felling the tree. This tree spreads downward with men etc., who are the products of their Karma, as branches. It again spreads above into Gandharvas, Yaksas, gods, etc. They are nourished by the Gunas of Sattva etc. They have tender shoots augmented by sense-objects. How does this happen?

Only this much is perceived: 'I am a man, the son of Devadatta, the father of Yajnadatta; I have property appropriate to these conditions'. Likewise, it is not understood that its destruction can be brought about by detachment from enjoyments which are based on Gunas. Similarly it is not perceived that attachment to the Gunas alone is the beginning of this (tree). Again, it is not perceived that the basis of this tree is founded on ignorance which is the misconception of self as non-self. Ignorance alone is the basis of this tree, since in it alone the tree is fixed. This Asvattha, described above, firm-rooted, i.e., the roots of which are firm and manifold, is to be cut off by the strong axe of detachment, namely, detachment from the sense objects composed of the three Gunas. This can be forged through perfect knowledge. As one gains detachment from sense-objects, one should seek and find out the goal from which nobody ever returns. How does this attachment to sense-objects, which consists of the Gunas and erroneous knowledge forming its cause, cease to exist? Sri Krsna now answers: One should seek 'refuge (Prapadyet) in the Primal Person' alone in order to overcome this ignorance. One should seek refuge (Prapadyeta) in Him who is primal, namely, the beginning of all entities, as stated in the following text: 'With Me as the Lord, the Prakrti gives birth to all that which moves, and that which does not move' (9.10), 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8), and 'There is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna' (7.7). From Me, the creator of everything, has streamed forth this ancient activity, continuing from time immermorial, of attachment to sense-objects consisting of Gunas. This has been declared already by Me: 'For this divine Maya of Mine consisting of the Gunas is hard to break through. But those who take refuge in me alone shall pass beyond this Maya' (7.14). Or a variant of this stanza is 'prapadya iyatah pravrttih' (in place of 'prapadyet yatah pravrittih'). This gives the sense that this discipline of taking refuge in the Supreme Person for dispelling of ignorance has continued from a distant past. The tendencies of ancient persons seeking liberation are also ancient. The purport is this: The ancient liberation-seekers, taking refuge in Me alone, were released from bondage. [This can be taken to mean that Prapatti or taking refuge in the Lord had originated in the Bhakti tradition of the Sri-Vaisnavites from ancient sages i.e., from the Alvars who preceded Ramanuja by several centuries. It is not a creation of Ramanuja]."

      "English": "15.3 - 15.4 The form of this tree, having its origin above, i.e., in the four-faced Brahma and branches below in the sense that man forms the crest through continual lineage therefrom, and also having its branches extended above and below by actions done in the human state and forming secondary roots - that form of the tree is not understood by people immersed in Samsara. Only this much is perceived: 'I am a man, the son of Devadatta, the father of Yajnadatta; I have property appropriate to these conditions'. Likewise, it is not understood that its destruction can be brought about by detachment from enjoyments which are based on Gunas. Similarly it is not perceived that attachment to the Gunas alone is the beginning of this (tree). Again, it is not perceived that the basis of this tree is founded on ignorance which is the misconception of self as non-self. Ignorance alone is the basis of this tree, since in it alone the tree is fixed. This Asvattha, described above, firm-rooted, i.e., the roots of which are firm and manifold, is to be cut off by the strong axe of detachment, namely, detachment from the sense objects composed of the three Gunas. This can be forged through perfect knowledge. As one gains detachment from sense-objects, one should seek and find out the goal from which nobody ever returns. How does this attachment to sense-objects, which consists of the Gunas and erroneous knowledge forming its cause, cease to exist? Sri Krsna now answers: One should seek 'refuge (Prapadyet) in the Primal Person' alone in order to overcome this ignorance. One should seek refuge (Prapadyeta) in Him who is primal, namely, the beginning of all entities, as stated in the following text: 'With Me as the Lord, the Prakrti gives birth to all that which moves, and that which does not move' (9.10), 'I am the origin of all; from Me proceed everything' (10.8), and 'There is nothing higher than Me, O Arjuna' (7.7). From Me, the creator of everything, has streamed forth this ancient activity, continuing from time immermorial, of attachment to sense-objects consisting of Gunas. This has been declared already by Me: 'For this divine Maya of Mine consisting of the Gunas is hard to break through. But those who take refuge in me alone shall pass beyond this Maya' (7.14). Or a variant of this stanza is 'prapadya iyatah pravrttih' (in place of 'prapadyet yatah pravrittih'). This gives the sense that this discipline of taking refuge in the Supreme Person for dispelling of ignorance has continued from a distant past. The tendencies of ancient persons seeking liberation are also ancient. The purport is this: The ancient liberation-seekers, taking refuge in Me alone, were released from bondage. [This can be taken to mean that Prapatti or taking refuge in the Lord had originated in the Bhakti tradition of the Sri-Vaisnavites from ancient sages i.e., from the Alvars who preceded Ramanuja by several centuries. It is not a creation of Ramanuja].

It has been taught that the way for the erasing of Karma is self-surrender to the Lord through detachment etc. That supreme light, reaching which they do not return any more is the self, which is My glory (Vibhuti) and therefore belongs to Me and is a part of Myself.

So the Srutis declare in the following texts: 'Entering within, He is the ruler of all things and the Self of all' (Tai. A., 3.11), 'He who, dwelling in the earth ৷৷. He who, dwelling in the self, is within the self ৷৷. who controls the earth' (Br. U. Madh., 3.7. 3. 22); 'The heart which is comparable to an inverted lotus-bud' (Ma. Na., 11.7); and 'Now, here, in the city of brahman, is an abode, a small lotus-flower' (Cha. U., 8.1.1). The Smrtis also declare thus: 'Visnu is the ruler of the whole universe, who permeates the universe' (V. P., 1.17. 20), 'He is the ruler of all, who is minutely small among those who are minutely small (Manu., 12.122); and 'He is the controller, the judge, the King, who is seated in your heart' (Ibid., 8.92). Therefore, the memory of all beings springs from Me alone. 'Memory' is knowledge springing from experience and its subtle impressions. They have for their contents past experiences. 'Knowledge' is determination of a thing through the senses, inference, the scriptures and intuitive meditation. This is also from Me. So does 'Apohana' too. 'Apohana' signifies the cessation of knowledge. 'Apohana' may also mean 'Uhana' (conjectural knowledge). Uhana is 'Uha' (conjecture). 'Uha' is that knowledge which is accessory to the actual means of knowledge (Pramana). It is done by determining whether that means of knowledge can be operative with reference to the particular subject-matter on hand, through the examination of the instruments of that means of knowledge (Pramana). This 'Uha' also comes from Me. Indeed 'I am to be known from all the Vedas,' for I am the inner ruler of Agni, Surya, Soma, Vayu, Sun and Indra and other divinities as their self. The Vedas are intent on speaking of them (i.e., the divinities). 'I am to be known from all the Vedas; for, terms like gods, men etc., signify the individual selves in them. I bring about the fruition of the Veda. 'Vedanta', here means the end, namely, the fruition, of Vedic injunctions like 'Let sacrifice be made to Indra' and 'Let sacrifice be made to Varuna.' For, all Vedas find their consummation in fruition. 'Antakrt' means grantor of fruits. The meaning is: 'I alone am the grantor of the fruition described in the Vedas.' This has been already declared in the verses beginning from, 'Whichever devotee seeks to worship with faith whatever form' and ending with, 'From that faith he gets the objects of his desire, granted in reality by Me alone' (7.21 - 22); and also 'I am the enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices' (9.24). I am the knower of the Vedas; I know the Veda that speaks about Me. The sense is that he who speaks of the meaning of the Vedas as otherwise than this import, is not the knower of the Vedas. Therefore, listen from Me alone the meaning or the essene of the Vedas."

That which is the 'imperishable' (Aksara) is called 'unchanging' (Kutastha), this is the released self, devoid of association with non-conscient matter, remaining in its own form. It is called 'unchangeable' inasmuch as when free from non-conscient matter, It has no specific connection with particular transformations of non-conscient matter like the bodies of Brahma etc. Here also the designation of the term in singular (as expressing a generic class) denoting the totality of liberated selves, is used on account of the single condition of dissociation from non-conscient matter. It does not mean that before this, in time without beginning, there existed but a single liberated self. So it is stated: 'Purified by the austerity of knowledge, many have attained My state' (4.10); and 'They are not born at the time of creation, nor do they suffer at the time of dissolution' (14.2)."

He forms a completely different category. All Srutis call Him the Supreme Self. But by that very designation as the Supreme Self, it may be known that the Supreme Person is a category distinct from the bound and the liberated selves. How? 'Entering the threefold world,' supports it. 'Loka' (world) is that which is perceived. There are three such perceivable worlds, He enters the 'three worlds' which can be understood from the authority of the Srutis. These are the world of unconscient matter, the world of conscient selves conjoined with matter, and the world of liberated selves. As understandable from the Srutis, He enters into these three categories as their Atman and supports them. Thus, He is an entity different from the triad which He pervades and maintains. Further He is different, as He is imperishable and as He is the Lord. Being imperishable, He is different from the bound non-conscient matter whose nature is subject to decay. He is different from the bound conscient selves as the latter is subject to Prakrti and follows its laws. He is also distinguished from the liberated selves, because in their previous condition they were connected with matter and mixed with it. Similarly, He is the Lord of these 'three worlds,' a category distinct from those which have to be ruled."

The meaning is that what-ever a Brahmana has to do as a conseence of his special birth (as a Brahmana), all that becomes accomplished when the reality of the Lord is known. The idea is that nobody's duties become fulfilled in any other way. And it has been said, 'O son of Prtha, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge' (4.33). There is also a saying from Manu: 'This, verily, is the fulfilment of a Brahmana in particular. For, by getting this, a twice-born has his duties fulfilled; not otherwise' (Ma. Sm. 12.93).

Vasana (subtle impression), Ruci (taste) and Sraddha (faith) are the alities of the self born from its association with the Gunas. The Sattva and the other Gunas are the alities of the body, the senses, the internal organs and sense-objects. They bring about their alities in the self associated with them. These are the Vasanas.

Here, the problem is, whether the Tyaga taught in the Sastras concern desiderative acts themselves, or fruits of all acts. Sri Krsna has used the terms Sannyasa in one place and Tyaga elsewhere. From this it is understood that Sri Krsna uses the terms Tyaga and Sannyasa as synonyms. Likewise, the decisive teaching is about Tyaga alone in the statement: 'Hear My decision, O Arjuna, about Tyaga' (18.4). That the terms are synonymously used to denote the same sense, is conclusively established from such passages as: 'But the renunciation (Sannyasa) of obligatory work is not proper. Abandonment (Tyaga) of it through delusion is declared to be Tamasika' (18.7); and 'To those who have not renounced the fruits of actions, threefold are the conseences after death - undesirable, desriable and mixed.

      "English": "18.3 Eke, some; manisinah, learned ones, subscribing to the views of the Sankhyas and others; prahuh, say; that dosavat, beset with evil (as it is);-What is it?- karma, action, all actions, becuase they are the cause of bondage; tyajyam, should be given up even by those who are eligible for actions (rites and duties). Or, it (action) is to be given up dosavat, just as defects such as attachment etc. are renounced. Ca and, in that very context; apare, others; (say) that yajana-dana-tapah-karma, the practice of sacrifice, charity and auterity; na tyajyam, should not be given up. These alternatives are with regard to only those who are alified for action, but not with regard to the monks who are steadfast in Knowledge and have gone beyond the stages of life. This discussion is not concerned with those who are held to be outside the scope of eligibility for action in the assertion (by the Lord), 'The steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge by men of realization was spoken of by Me in the days of yore' (see 3.3). Objection: Well, just as those who are alified for rites and duties and who have their distinct steadfastness are being considered here in the chapter summarizing the entire scripture, though they have been dealt with earlier in '৷৷.through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3), similarly, let even the men of realization who are steadfast in Knowledge be considered here. Reply: No, because it is not logical that their renunciation should result from delusion and sorrow (cf. 7 and 8). The men of realization do not perceive in the Self the sorrows arising from physical torment; for it has been shown that desire etc. are attributes only of the field (body) (see 13.6). Therefore, they do not renounce action but of fear for physical trouble and pain. Nor do they perceive actions in the Self, on account of which they should give up obligatory duties out of delusion. In fact, they renounce with the conviction that 'action belongs to the organs' (see 3.28); 'I certainly do not do anything' (see 5.8); for, the mode of renunciation of an enlightened person was shown in, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally' (5.13). Therefore, those others who are alified for rites and duties, who are unelightened about the Self, and for whom renunciation is possible out of delusion and from fear of physical trouble, are alone condemned as persons who, being possessed of tamas and rajas, resort to renunciation. And this is done with a veiw to eulogizing the renunciation of the results of rites and duties by the unenlightened men of action. Besides, the men of renunciation in the real sense have been particularly pointed out in, 'who has renounced ever undertaking,' 'who is silent, content with anything, homeless, steadyminded' (12.16, 19), and also (while determining) the characteristics of one who has transcended the gunas (Chapter 14). The Lord will further say, '৷৷.which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge' (50). Therefore the monks steadfast in Knowledge are not intended to be spoken of here. It is only the abandoning of the results of action which, by virtue of its being imbued with the ality of sattva, is spoken of as sannyasa in contrast to the renunciation of actions which is possessed of tamas etc.; it is not sannyasa in the primary-sense-the renunciation of all actions. Objection: According to the reason shown in the text, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the actions entirely' (11), may it not be argued that the word sannyasa is certainly used in the primary sense because it is impossible to abandon all works? Reply: No, for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy. Just as, 'From renunciation immediately (follows) Peace' (12.12), is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action, it having been enjoined on Arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives (paths) as stated earlier, so also is this sentence, 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' (11), meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions. No one can point an exception to the proposition that 'having given up all actions mentally, (the embodied man of self-control) continues happily৷৷.without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (see 5.13). Therefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are alified for rites and duties. But the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme Truth are competent only for steadfastness in Knowledge, which is characterized by renunciation of all actions; not for anything else. Hence, they do not come within the purview of the alternative veiws. Thus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text, '৷৷.he who knows this One as indestructible৷৷.' (2.21) as also in the beginning of the third chapter."

It is contained in the statement, 'Surrendering all your actions to Me with a mind focussed on the self,' and 'Free from desire and selfishness and cured of fever - fight' (3.30). The renunciation of fruits consists in the following manner. 'Heaven and such other results arising from acts do not belong to Me.' Renunciation of acts is complete abandonment of the sense of possession in regard to one's acts. This sense of possession is of the following nature: 'Those acts are mine on account of their being the means for fruits which are to be mine.' Renunciation referring to agency is the renunciation of agency of oneself by ascribing the agency to the Lord of all."

Iti, this; is me, My; niscitam, firm; and uttamam, best; matam, conculsion. Having promised, 'hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that (tyaga)' (4) and also adduced the reason that they are purifiers, the utterance, 'Even these actions have to be performed. This is the firm and best conclusion', is only by way of concluding the promised subject-matter; this sentence does not introduce a fresh topic. For it stands to reason that the phrase 'even these' refers to some immediate topic under discussion. The implication of the word api (even) is: 'Even these acts, which are causes of bondage to one who has attachment and who hankers after their results, have to be undertaken by a seeker of Liberation.' But the phrase 'even these' is not used in relation to other acts. Others explain (thus): Since the nityakarmas have no results, therefore (in their case) it is illogical to say, 'by giving up attachment and (hankering for their) results'. The meaning of the phrase etani api (even these) is that, 'even these rites and duties, which are undertaken for desired results and are different from the nityakarmas, have to be undertaken. What to speak of the nityakarmas like sacrifice, charity and austerity!' (Reply:) This is wrong since it has been established by the text, 'sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers,' that even the nityakarmas have results. For a seeker of Liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage, how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? Moreover, the phrase etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas), since they have been denigrated in, '৷৷.indeed, actions is ite inferior' (2.49), and in, '৷৷.by actions other than that action meant for God' (3.9), and since, on the strength of the texts [Which support the two earlier arguments.], 'the Vedas have the three alities as their object' (2.45), 'Those who are versed in the Vedas, who are drinkers of Soma,৷৷.(pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping) Me' (9.20), and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit' (9.21), it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of bondage; and also because they are far removed from the context."

The sustenance of the body by eating the sacrificial remnants produces perfect knowledge. Otherwise, as declared in the statement, 'But the sinful ones eat sin' (3.13). The satisfaction that comes by eating food which is not the remnant of sacrifice and which is therefore of the form of sin, is productive of erroneous knowledge in the mind. For, as declared in the Sruti, 'The mind consists of food' (Cha. U., 6.5.4), the mind is sustained by food. Also, there is the Sruti text, 'When the food is pure, the mind becomes pure; when the mind is pure, remembrance becomes firmly fixed; and when remembrance is acired, there is release from all knots of the heart' (Ibid., 7.26.2). It is therefore proved by the Sruti that knowledge of the form of direct perception of Brahman, is dependent on the purity of food. Hence the great sacrifices and such other obligatory and occasional rites are worthy of adoption till one's death, as they help in the knowledge of the Brahman. The renunciation of these is therefore not proper. Thus, the relinishment of these acts which produce knowledge through the delusion that they bind the self, is rooted in Tamas. Tamasika renunciation has its roots in Tamas. Since such renunciation has its roots in ignorance which is the effect of Tamas, such renunciation is said to have its roots in Tamas. For Tamas is the root of ignorance as has been stated: 'From Tamas arise negligence and delusion, and also, ignorance' (14.17). Ignorance is erroneous knowledge which is antagonistic to right knowledge. So, it will be taught, 'That reason which, enveloped in Tamas, regards wrong as right, and which reverses every value, O Arjuna, is Tamasika' (18.32). It is for this reason that the renunciation of obligatory and occasional actions are said to have their roots in erroneous knowledge."

As to this, the Lord aborts even that imagination by saying, 'by giving up the result'. Hence it has been well said, 'by giving up attachment and the result'. Objection: Well, is not the threefold relinishment of actions, also called sannyasa, under discussion? As regards this, the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated. Why is the relinishment of attachment and (desire for their) results spoken of here as the third? This is like somody saying, 'Three Brahmanas have come.

Reply: This is not wrong, for this is meant as a eulogy on the basis of the common factor of renunciation. Between renunciation of actions and renunciation. of hankering for results, there is, indeed, the similarity of the fact of renunciation. While on this subject, by condemning 'renunciation of actions' on account of its being based on rajas and tamas, the 'renunciation of desire for results of actions' is being praised on account of its being based on sattva, by saying, 'that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.' The internal organ of a person who is alified for rites and duties, who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results, becomes pure on account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc. and refined by the nitya-karmas. When it is pure and tranil, it becomes capable of contemplating on the Self. Since, for that very person whose internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas and who has become ready for the knowledge of the Self, the process by which he can become steadfast in it has to be stated, therefore the Lord says:"

That Sattva generates the knowledge of things as they really are, has been taught in: 'From Sattva arises knowledge' (14.17), and it will be further declared: 'That reason by which one knows action and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and release, O Arjuna, is Sattvika' (18.30)."

Tyagi, the man of renunciation, who has become so by having given up attachment and rewards of action in the manner stated above. He is a tyagi who performs nityakarmas by relinishing attachment to those acts and (their) results. Again, it is being stated as to when that person does not hate an unbefitting act and does not become attached to a befitting activity: When he has become sattva-samavistah, imbued with sattva, i.e., when he is filled with, possessed of, sattva, which is the means to the knowledge that discriminates between the Self and the not-Self; and hence medhavi, wise-endowed with intelligence (medha), intuitive experience, characterized as knowledge of the Self; one possessed of that is medhavai (wise)-; and owing to the very fact of being wise, chinnasamsayah, freed from doubts-one whose doubts created by ignorance have been sundered, one who is freed from doubts by his firm conviction that nothing but abiding in the ture nature of the Self is the supreme means to the highest Good. The person competent (for rites and duties) who, having gradually become purified in mind through the practice of Karma-yoga in the way described above, has realized as his own Self the actionless Self, which is devoid of modifications like birth etc., he, '৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, remaining at without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (cf. 5.13), attains steadfastness in Knowledge, which is characterized as 'actionless-ness'. In this way, the purpose of the aforesaid Karma-yoga has been stated through the present verse. On the other hand, since, for the unenlightened person-who, while being alified (for rites and duties), holds on to the body owing to the erroneous conception that the body is the Self, and who has the firm conviction, 'I am the agent,' because of the persistence of his idea that the Self is the agent-it is not possible to renounce actions totally, therefore he has competence only for performing enjoined duties by giving up fruits of actions. But he is not to renounce them (actions). In order to point out this idea the Lord says:"

He 'neither hates works productive of harmful effects,' nor 'loves others productive of worldly prosperity.' Disagreeable acts are fraught with undesirable fruits; and agreeable acts bring about desirable results such as heaven, sons, cows, food etc. On account of his renouncing all results other than the Brahman and on account of his renouncing the sense of agency, he shows neither love nor hatred for above-mentioned types of works. Here 'sinful acts having undesirable fruits' are only such acts as are inadvertently performed. For it has been taught in the Srutis that nor turning away from bad conduct is antagonistic to the production of knowledge. 'But one who has not ceased from bad conduct, who is not tranil, is not composed, is not of peaceful mind, cannot obtain Him by knowledge' (Ka. U., 1.2.24). Thus, 'the abandonment' according to the Sastras is renunciation of the sense of agency, attachment and fruits of actions, and not total relinishment of actions as such. He explains this further:"

He who has given up the fruits of the five great sacrifices, is said to have renounced; this is referred to in the Srutis such as: 'Only through renunciation do some obtain immortality' (Ma. Na., 8.14). Renunciation of fruits of actions is illustrative; it implies much more. It implies one who has renounced the fruits, agency and attachment to works, as the topic has been begun with the declaration: 'For abandonment (Tyaga) is declard to be of three kinds' (18.4). This statement may be estioned in the following manner: 'Agnihotra, the full moon and new moon sacrifices, Jyotistoma etc., and also the five great sacrifices are enjoined by the Sastras only for the attainment of their results like heaven. They are not purposeless. Even the injunction with regard to obligatory and occasional ceremonies is enjoined because they yield results, as implied in the following passage: \"For householders, Prajapatya ceremony\" (V.P., 1.6.37). Therefore, as the performance of actions has to be understood as a means for attaining their respective results, the accruing of agreeable and disagreeable results is inevitable, even though they are performed without any desire for fruits, just as a seed sown must grow into a tree and bear fruit. Hence, actions ought not to be performed by an aspirant for release, because the results are incompatible with release. Sri Krsna answers such objections:"

      "English": "18.12 The 'undesirable result' is Naraka etc., 'the desirable' is heaven etc., 'the mixed' is sons, cows, food etc., which are combined with some undesirable results. Those who have not renounced, namely, those who are devoid of renunciation of agency, possessiveness and fruits - they meet with threefold conseences after death. The meaning of 'after death' (Pretya) may be understood as subseent to the performance of actions. But 'to those who have renounced, none whatsoever,' viz., to those who have relinished the sense of agency etc., no such results antagonistic to release accrue. Here the purport is this: Agnihotra, the great sacrifices etc. are obligatory throughout life and are reired for attaining the objects of desire; but in regard to release their application is different. Though externally they appear to be the same in their nature in both the conditions, they are different in their fruits by virtue of difference in application. Their application to release is seen in such texts as 'The Brahmanas desire to know Him by the study of the Vedas, by sacrifices, by gifts, by austerities conjoined with fasting' (Br. U., 4.4.22). Here the performance of actions without sense of agency is enforced. Such giving up agency etc., are relevant only with regard to acts that are actually performed. Thus Sannyasa or renouncing of this kind is established in the Sastras. The same is also called Tyaga or giving up. Sri Krsna now explains the manner of realising that one is non-agent, by attributing all agency to God, who is the Supreme Person and the Inner Ruler, By cultivating this attitude, an aspirant can attain the renunciation of possessiveness with regard to actions and also their fruits. For it is the Supreme Person who performs all actions through the individual selves who belong to Him. The organs, bodies and Pranas of embodied beings are His. They exist for the sake of His own sport as the only purpose. Therefore, even the appeasement of hunger etc., and such other acts which affect the life of the individual souls and their works constitute only the means for accomplishing that purpose, namely, the sport of the Highest Purusa Himself. The purport of the argument is this: The analogy of seeds producing the tree and its fruits is not applicable to the actions of release-seekers. Their actions may look like those of fruit-seekers externally. But as mentally they do not entertain any such purpose, the conseence of their actions can be ite different. The purpose served by their actions is only affording sport for the Supreme Being."

      "English": "18.14 - 18.15 For all actions, performed through body, words or mind, whether they be authorized by the Sastras or not, the causes are these five. (1) The body, which is a conglomeration of the 'great elements,' is known as the seat, since it is governed by the individual self. (2) The agent is the individual self. That this individual self is the knower and the agent is established in the Vedanta-Sutras: 'For this reason, (the individual self) is the knower' (2.3.18) and 'The agent, on account of the scripture having a purport' (2.3.33.). (3) The organs of various kinds are the five motor organs like that of speech, hands, feet etc., along with the mind. They are of various kinds, viz., they have different functions in completing an action. (4) The different and distinctive functions of vital air - here the expression 'functions' (Cesta) means several functions. Distinctive are the functions of this fivefold vital air which sustains the body and senses through its divisions of Prana, Apana etc. (5) Divinity is the fifth among these causes. The purport is this: Among these, which constitute the conglomeration of causes of work the Divinity is the fifth. It is the Supreme Self, the Inner Ruler, who is the main cause in completing the action. It has been already affirmed: 'I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also' (15.15), and He will say further: 'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of every being casuing them to spin round and round by His power as if set on a wheel' (18.61). The agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self as established in the aphorism: 'But from the Supreme, because the scripture says so' (B. S., 2.3.41). Now an objection may be raised in this way: If the agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self and the individual self cannot be charged with moral responsibility, then the scriptures containing injunctions and prohibitions become useless, as the individual self cannot be enjoined to act in regard to any action. The objection is disposed off by the author of the Vedanta-Sutras in the aphorism: 'But with a view to the effects made on account of the purposelessness of injunctions and prohibitions' (2.3.42).

      "English": "18.14 - 18.15 For all actions, performed through body, words or mind, whether they be authorized by the Sastras or not, the causes are these five. (1) The body, which is a conglomeration of the 'great elements,' is known as the seat, since it is governed by the individual self. (2) The agent is the individual self. That this individual self is the knower and the agent is established in the Vedanta-Sutras: 'For this reason, (the individual self) is the knower' (2.3.18) and 'The agent, on account of the scripture having a purport' (2.3.33.). (3) The organs of various kinds are the five motor organs like that of speech, hands, feet etc., along with the mind. They are of various kinds, viz., they have different functions in completing an action. (4) The different and distinctive functions of vital air - here the expression 'functions' (Cesta) means several functions. Distinctive are the functions of this fivefold vital air which sustains the body and senses through its divisions of Prana, Apana etc. (5) Divinity is the fifth among these causes. The purport is this: Among these, which constitute the conglomeration of causes of work the Divinity is the fifth. It is the Supreme Self, the Inner Ruler, who is the main cause in completing the action. It has been already affirmed: 'I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their removal also' (15.15), and He will say further: 'The Lord, O Arjuna, lives in the heart of every being casuing them to spin round and round by His power as if set on a wheel' (18.61). The agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self as established in the aphorism: 'But from the Supreme, because the scripture says so' (B. S., 2.3.41). Now an objection may be raised in this way: If the agency of the individual self is dependent on the Supreme Self and the individual self cannot be charged with moral responsibility, then the scriptures containing injunctions and prohibitions become useless, as the individual self cannot be enjoined to act in regard to any action. The objection is disposed off by the author of the Vedanta-Sutras in the aphorism: 'But with a view to the effects made on account of the purposelessness of injunctions and prohibitions' (2.3.42). The purport is this: By means of his senses, body etc., granted by the Supreme Self - having Him for their support, empowered by Him, and thus deriving power from Him - the individual self begins, of his own free will, the effort for directing the senses etc., for the purpose of performing actions conditioned by his body and organs. The individual self Itself, of Its own free will, is responsible for activity, since the Supreme Self, abiding within, causes It to act only by granting His permission, just as works such as moving heavy stones and timber are collectively the labour of many persons and they are together responsible for the effect.

      "English": "18.17 Yasya, he who, the person whose intellect is refined by the instructions of the scriptures and the teachers, and reason; who has na, not; ahankrtah bhavah, the feeling of egoism, in whom does not occur the notion in the form, 'I am the agent'; i.e., he who sees thus: 'These five, viz locus etc. (14), imagined in the Self through ignorance, are verily the agents of all actions; not I. But I am the absolute, unchanging witness of their functions, 'Without vita force, without mind, pure, superior to the (other) superior immutable (Maya)\" (Mu. 2.1.1)'; yasya, whose; buddhih, intellect, the internal organ, which is the limiting adunct of the Self; is na, not; lipyate, tainted, does not become regretful thinking, 'I have done this; as a result, I shall enter into hell'; whose intellect does not become thus tainted, he has a good intellect and he perceives (rightly). Api, even; hatva, by killing; iman, these; lokan, creatures, i.e. all living beings; sah he; does not hanti, kill-he does not perform the act of killing; nor does he nibadhyate, become bound, nor even does he become connected with its result, the fruit of an unrighteous action. Objection: Even if this be a eulogy, is it not contradictory to say, 'even by killing he does not kill'? Reply: This defect does not arise; for this becomes logical from the ordinary and the enlightened points of view. By adopting the empirical point of view (which consists in thinking), 'I am the slayer', by identifying the body with the Self, the Lord says, 'even by killing'; and, by taking His stand on the supreme Truth as explained above (the Lord says), 'he does not kill, nor does he become bound'. Thus both these surely become reasonable. Objection; Is it not that the Self certainly does act in combination with the locus etc., which conclusion follows from the use of the word kevala (absolute) in the text, 'the absolute Self as the agent' (16)? Reply: There is not such fault, because, the Self being changeless by nature, there is no possiblity of Its becoming united with the locus etc. For it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another, or come to have agentship through combination. But, for the changeless Self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever. Hence, agentship through combination is not logical. Therefore, the absoluteness of the Self being natural, the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact. And the changelessness of the Self is well known from the Upanisads, the Smrtis and logic. As to that, in the Gita itself this has been established more than once in such texts as, 'It is said that৷৷.This is unchangeable' (2.25), 'Actions are being done by the gunas themselves' (see 3.27), 'this ৷৷.supreme Self does not act৷৷.although existing in the body' (13.31), and in the Upanisads also in such texts as, 'It thinks, as it were, and shakes, as it were' (Br. 4.3.7). And from the standpoint of reason also, the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the Self is that It is partless, independent of others and changeless. Even if mutability (of the Self) be accepted, It should have a change that is Its own. The functions of the locus etc. cannot be attributed to the agency of the Self. Indeed, an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has not been done! As for what is imputed (on somody) through ignorance, that is not his. As the ality of silver is not of nacre, or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky, similarly, the changes in the locus etc. also are verily their own, and not of the Self. Hence it has been well said that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor is he bound', becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself. [Some translate this portion thus: '৷৷.because of the absence of the thought 'I am doing', and also due to the taintlessness of the mind'; or, '৷৷.in the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind'.-Tr.] After having declared, 'This One does not kill, nor is It killed' (2.19); having stated the immutability of the Self through such texts as, 'Never is this One born' (2.20) , etc., which adduce the reason for this; having briefly stated at the commencement of the Scripture-in, 'he who knows this One as indestructible' (2.21)-that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties; and having deliberated in various places on that (cessation) which has been mooted in the middle (of the Scripture), the Lord, by way of summarizing the purport of the Scripture, concludes here by saying that the enlightened person 'does not kill, nor does he become bound.' If this be so, then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions, viz the undesirable etc., do not accrue to the monks, since it is reasonable that, because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied, all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned (by them). And hence, as a conseence of a reversal of this, it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to others. Thus, this is how the purport of the scripture Gita has been summed up. In order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the Vedas should be. understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect, it has been explained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning, in various places by dealing with it topically. Thereafter, now is being stated what promts actions:"

He explains the same: As Karma consists of the activities of the sense-organs, it is ordained by Nature for one who is conjoined with Prakrti, i.e., the body. So by performing Karma Yoga one does not incur any stain. But Jnana Yoga is liable to negligence, because it reires the control of the senses from the very beginning for its performance.

ऐसे दोषयुक्त भी अपने सहजकर्मको नहीं छोड़ना चाहिये। क्योंकि सभी आरम्भजो आरम्भ किये जाते हैं उनका नाम आरम्भ है? अतः यहाँ प्रकरणके अनुसार सर्वारम्भका तात्पर्य समस्त कर्म है। सा स्वधर्म या परधर्मरूप जो कुछ भी कर्म है? वे सभी तीनों गुणोंके कार्य हैं। अतः त्रिगुणात्मक होनेके कारण? साथ जन्मे हुए धुएँसे अग्निकी भाँति दोषसे आवृत हैं। अभिप्राय यह है कि स्वधर्म नामक सहजकर्मका परित्याग करनेसे और परधर्मका ग्रहण करनेसे भी? दोषसे छुटकारा नहीं हो सकता और परधर्म भयावह भी है तथा अज्ञानीद्वारा सम्पूर्ण कर्मोंका पूर्णतया त्याग होना सम्भव भी नहीं है सुतरां सहजकर्मको नहीं छोड़ना चाहिये। ( यहाँ यह विचार करना चाहिये कि ) क्या कर्मोंका अशेषतः त्याग होना असम्भव है? इसलिये उनका त्याग नहीं करना चाहिये? अथवा सहज कर्मका त्याग करनेमें दोष है इसलिये पू0 -- इसमें क्या सिद्ध होगा उ0 -- यदि यह बात हो कि अशेषतः त्याग होना अशक्य है? इसलिये सहजकर्मोंका त्याग नहीं करना चाहिये? तब तो यही सिद्ध होगा कि कर्मोंका अशेषतः त्याग करनेमें गुण ही है। पू0 -- यह ठीक है? परंतु यदि कर्मोंका पूर्णतया त्याग हो ही नहीं सकता ( तो फिर गुणदोषकी बात ही क्या है ) उ0 -- तो क्या सांख्यवादियोंके गुणोंकी भाँति आत्मा सदा चलनस्वभाववाला है अथवा बौद्धमतावलम्बियोंके प्रतिक्षणमें नष्ट होनेवाले ( रूप? वेदना? विज्ञान? संज्ञा और संस्काररूप ) पञ्च स्कन्धोंकी भाँति क्रिया ही कारक है इन दोनों ही प्रकारोंसे कर्मोंका अशेषतः त्याग नहीं हो सकता। हाँ? तीसरा एक पक्ष और भी है कि जब आत्मा कर्म करता है तब तो वह सक्रिय होता है और जब कर्म नहीं करता? तब वही निष्क्रिय होता है? ऐसा मान लेनेसे कर्मोंका अशेषतः त्याग भी हो सकता है। इस तीसरे पक्षमें यह विशेषता है? कि न तो आत्मा नित्य चलनस्वभाववाला माना गया है? और न क्रियाको ही कारक माना गया है? तो फिर क्या है? कि अपने स्वरूपमें स्थित द्रव्यमें ही अविद्यमान क्रिया उत्पन्न हो जाती है और विद्यमान क्रियाका नाश हो जाता है शुद्ध द्रव्य? क्रियाकी शक्तिसे युक्त होकर स्थित रहता है और वही कारक है। इस प्रकार वैशेषिकमतावलम्बी कहते हैं। पू0 -- इस पक्षमें क्या दोष है उ0 -- इसमें प्रधान दोष तो यही है कि यह मत भगवान्को मान्य नहीं है। पू0 -- यह कैसे जाना जाता है। उ0 -- इसीलिये कि भगवान् तो असत् वस्तुका कभी भाव नहीं होता इत्यादि वचन कहते हैं और वैशेषिकमतवादी असत्का भाव और सत्का अभाव मानते हैं। पू0 -- भगवान्का मत न होनेपर भी यदि न्याययुक्त हो तो इसमें क्या दोष है उ0 -- बतलाते हैं ( सुनो ) सब प्रमाणोंसे इस मतका विरोध होनेके कारण भी यह मत दोषयुक्त है। पू0 -- किस प्रकार उ0 -- यदि यह माना जाय कि द्व्यणुक आदि द्रव्य उत्पत्तिसे पहले अत्यन्त असत् हुए ही उत्पन्न हो जाते हैं और किञ्चित् काल स्थित रहकर फिर अत्यन्त ही असत् भावको प्राप्त हो जाते हैं? तब तो यही मानना हुआ कि असत् ही सत् हो जाता है अर्थात् अभाव भाव हो जाता है और भाव अभाव हो जाता है। अर्थात् ( यह मानना हुआ कि ) उत्पन्न होनेवाला अभाव? उत्पत्तिसे पहले शश -- श्रृङ्गकी भाँति सर्वथा असत् होता हुआ ही? समवायि? असमवायि और निमित्त नामक तीन कारणोंकी सहायतासे उत्पन्न होता है। परंतु अभाव इस प्रकार उत्पन्न होता है अथवा कारणकी अपेक्षा रखता है -- यह कहना नहीं बनता क्योंकि खरगोशके सींग आदि असत् वस्तुओंमें ऐसा नहीं देखा जाता। हाँ? यदि यह माना जाय कि उत्पन्न होनेवाले घटादि भावरूप हैं और वे अभिव्यक्तिके किसी कारणकी सहायतासे उत्पन्न होते हैं? तो यह माना जा सकता है। तथा असत्का सत् और सत्का असत् होना मान लेनेपर तो किसीका प्रमाणप्रमेयव्यवहारमें कहीं विश्वास ही नहीं रहेगा क्योंकि ऐसा मान लेनेसे फिर यह निश्चय नहीं होगा कि सत् सत् ही है और असत् असत् ही है। इसके सिवा वे उत्पन्न होता है इस वाक्यसे द्व्यणुक आदि द्रव्यका अपने कारण और सत्तासे सम्बन्ध होना बतलाते हैं अर्थात् उत्पत्तिसे पहले कार्य असत् होता है? फिर अपने कारणके व्यापारकी अपेक्षासे,( सहायतासे ) अपने कारणरूप परमाणुओंसे और सत्तासे समवायरूप सम्बन्धके द्वारा संगठित हो जाता है और संगठित होकर कारणसे मिलकर सत् हो जाता है। इसपर उनको बतलाना चाहिये कि असत्का कारण सत् कैसे हो सकता है और असत्का किसीके साथ सम्बन्ध भी कैसे हो सकता है क्योंकि वन्ध्यापुत्रकी सत्ता? उसका किसी सत् पदार्थके साथ सम्बन्ध अथवा उसका कारण? किसीके भी द्वारा प्रमाणपूर्वक सिद्ध नहीं किया जा सकता। पू0 -- वैशेषिकमतवादी अभावका सम्बन्ध नहीं मानते। वे तो भावरूप द्व्यणुक आदि द्रव्योंका ही अपने कारणके साथ समवायरूप सम्बन्ध बतलाते हैं। उ0 -- यह बात नहीं है क्योंकि ( उनके मतमें ) कार्यकारणका सम्बन्ध होनेसे पहले कार्यकी सत्ता नहीं मानी गयी। अर्थात् वैशेषिकमतावलम्बी कुम्हार और दण्डचक्र आदिकी क्रिया आरम्भ होनेसे पहले घट आदिका अस्तित्व नहीं मानते और यह भी नहीं मानते कि मिट्टीको ही घटादिके आकारकी प्राप्ति हुई है। इसलिये अन्तमें असत्का ही सम्बन्ध मानना सिद्ध होता है। पू0 -- असत्का भी समवायरूप सम्बन्ध होना विरुद्ध नहीं है। उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि वन्ध्यापुत्र आदिका किसीके साथ सम्बन्ध नहीं देखा जाता। अभावकी समानता होनेपर भी यदि कहो कि घटादिके प्रागभावका ही अपने कारणके साथ सम्बन्ध होता है? वन्ध्यापुत्रादिके अभावका नहीं? तो इनके अभावोंका भेद बतलाना चाहिये। एकका अभाव? दोका अभाव? सबका अभाव? प्रागभाव? प्रध्वंसाभाव? अन्योन्याभाव? अत्यन्ताभाव इन लक्षणोंसे कोई भी अभावकी विशेषता नहीं दिखला सकता। फिर किसी प्रकारकी विशेषता न होते हुए भी यह कहना कि घटका प्रागभाव ही कुम्हार आदिके द्वारा घटभावको प्राप्त होता है तथा उसका कपालनामक अपने कारणरूप भावसे सम्बन्ध होता है और वह सब व्यवहारके योग्य भी होता है। परंतु उसी घटका जो प्रध्वंसाभाव है? वह अभावत्वमें समान होनेपर भी सम्बन्धित नहीं होता। इस तरह प्रध्वंसादि अभावोंको किसी भी अवस्थामें व्यवहारके योग्य न मानना और केवल द्व्यणुक आदि द्रव्यनामक प्रागभावको ही उत्पत्ति आदि व्यवहारके योग्य मानना? असमञ्जसरूप ही है क्योंकि अत्यन्ताभाव और प्रध्वंसाभावके समान ही प्रागभावका भी अभावत्व है? उसमें कोई विशेषता नहीं है। पू0 -- हमने प्रागभावका भावरूप होना नहीं बतलाया है। उ0 -- तब तो तुमने भावका ही भावरूप हो जाना कहा है? जैसे घटका घटरूप हो जाना वस्त्रका वस्त्ररूप हो जाना परंतु यह भी अभावके भावरूप होनेकी भाँति ही प्रमाणविरुद्ध है। सांख्यमतावलम्बियोंका जो परिणामवाद है? उसमें अपूर्व धर्मकी उत्पत्ति और विनाश स्वीकार किया जानेके कारण? वह भी ( इस विषयमें ) वैशेषिकमतसे कुछ विशेषता नहीं रखता। अभिव्यक्ति ( प्रकट होना ) और तिरोभाव ( छिप जाना ) स्वीकार करनेसे भी? अभिव्यक्ति और तिरोभावकी विद्यमानता और अविद्यमानताका निरूपण करनेमें? पहलेकी भाँति ही प्रमाणसे विरोध होगा। इस विवेचनसे कारणका कार्यरूपमें स्थित होना ही उत्पत्ति आदि हैं ऐसा निरूपण करनेवाले मतका भी खण्डन हो जाता है। इन सब मतोंका खण्डन हो जानेपर अन्तमें यही सिद्ध होता है कि एक ही सत्य तत्त्व ( आत्मा ) अविद्याद्वारा नटकी भाँति उत्पत्ति? विनाश आदि धर्मोंसे अनेक रूपमें कल्पित होता है। यही भगवान्का अभिप्राय नासतो विद्यते भावः इस श्लोकमें बतलाया गया है क्योंकि सत्प्रत्ययका व्यभिचार नहीं होता और अन्य ( असत् ) प्रत्ययोंका व्यभिचार होता है ( अतः सत् ही एकमात्र तत्त्व है )। पू0 -- यदि ( भगवान्के मतमें ) आत्मा निर्विकार है तो ( वे ) यह कैसे कहते हैं कि अशेषतः कर्मोंका त्याग नहीं हो सकता उ0 -- शरीरइन्द्रियादिरूप गुण चाहे सत्य वस्तु हों? चाहे अविद्याकल्पित हों? जब कर्म उन्हींका धर्म है? तब आत्मामें तो वह अविद्याध्यारोपित ही है। इस कारण कोई भी अज्ञानी अशेषतः कर्मोंका त्याग क्षणभर भी नहीं कर सकता यह कहा गया है। परंतु विद्याद्वारा अविद्या निवृत्त हो जानेपर ज्ञानी तो कर्मोंका अशेषतः त्याग कर ही सकता है क्योंकि अविद्या नष्ट होनेके उपरान्त? अविद्यासे अध्यारोपित वस्तुका अंश बाकी नहीं रह सकता। ( यह प्रत्यक्ष ही है कि ) तिमिररोगसे विकृत हुई दृष्टिद्वारा अध्यारोपित दो चन्द्रमा आदिका कुछ भी अंश? तिमिररोग नष्ट हो जानेपर? शेष नहीं रहता। सुतरां सब कर्मोंको मनसे छोड़कर इत्यादि कथन ठीक ही हैं। तथा अपनेअपने कर्मोंमें लगे हुए मनुष्य संसिद्धिको प्राप्त होते हैं मनुष्य अपने कर्मोंसे उसकी पूजा करके सिद्धि प्राप्त करता है -- ये कथन भी ठीक हैं।",

Opponent: If it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinish it totally, then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation (of duty) is surely meritorious!

Is a person ever-changeful like the gunas of the Sankhyas, or is it that action itself is the agent, as it is in the case of the momentary five [Rupa (from), vedana (feeling), vijnana (momentary consciousness), sanjna (notion), samskara (mental impressions)-these have only momentary existence. In their case there can be no distinction between action and agent, simply due to the fact of their being momentary.] forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the Buddhists? In either case there can be no complete renunciation of action. Then there is also a third standpoint (as held by the Vaisesikas): When a thing acts it is active, and inactive when that very thing does not act. If this be the case here, it is possible to entirely give up actions. But the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing is not ever-changing, nor is action itself the agent. What then? A nonexistent action originates in an existing thing, and an existing action gets destroyed. The thing-in-itself continues to exist along with its power (to act), and that itself is the agent. This is what the followers of Kanada say. [Their view is that agentship consists in 'possessing the power to act', not in being the substratum of action.] What is wrong with this point of view. Vedantin: The defect indeed lies in this that, this veiw is not in accord with the Lord's view. Objection: How is this known? Vedantin: Since the Lord as said, 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.,' etc. (2.16). The view of the followers of Kanada is, indeed, this that the non-existent becomes existent, and the existent becomes nonexistent. Objection: What defect can there be if it be that this view, even though not the view of the Lord, yet conforms to reason? Vedantin: The answer is: This is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence. Objection: How? Vedantin: As to this, if things like a dvyanuka (dyad of two anus, atoms) be absolutely nonexistent before origination, and after origination continue for a little while, and again become absolutely non-existent, then, in that acase, the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being, [Here Ast. adds, 'sadeva asattvam apadyate, that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent'.-Tr.] a non-entity becomes an entity, and an entity becomes a non-entity! If this be the view, then the non-enity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born, and it comes into being with the help of what are called material (inherent), non-mateial (non-inherent) and efficient causes. But it cannot be said that nonexistence has origination in this way, or that it depends on some cause, since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare, etc. If such things as pot etc. which are being produced be of the nature of (potentially) existing things, then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them. [According to Vedanta, before origination a thing, e.g. a pot, remains latent in its material cause, clay for instance, with its name and form unexpressed, and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form.] Moreover, if the nonexistent becomes existent, and the existent becomes non-existent, then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge, because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent! Further, when they speak of origination, they (the Viasesikas) hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka (dyad) comes to have relationship with its own (material) causes (the two atoms) and existence, and that it is nonexistent before origination; but later on, depending on the operation of its own causes, it becomes connected with its own causes, viz the atoms, as also with existence, through the inherent (or inseparable) relationship called samavaya. After becoming connected, it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes. [The effect (dyad) has inherent relationship with existence after its material causes (the two atoms) come into association.] It has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase, or have relationship with anything. For nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a son of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause. Vaisesika: Is it not that relationship of a non-existent thing is not at all established by the Vaisesikas? Indeed, what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka etc. have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes. Vedantin: No, for it is not admitted (by them) that anything has existence before the (samavaya) relationship (occurs). It is surely not held by the Vaisesikas that a pot etc. have any existence before the potter, (his) stick, wheel, etc. start functioning. Nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot etc. As a result, it has to be admitted (by them) as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship! Vaisesika: Well, it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence. Vedantin: No, because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman etc. If the antecedent nonexistence (prag-abhava) of the pot etc. alone comes into a relationship with its own (material) cause, but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman etc. though as nonexistence both are the same, then the distinction between the (two) nonexistences has to be explained. Through such descriptions ( of abhava, nonexistence) as nonexistence of one, nonexistence of two, nonexistence of all, antecedent nonexistence, nonexistence after destruction, mutual nonexistence and absolute non-existence, nobody can show any distinction (as regards nonexistence itself)! There being no distinction, (therefore, to say that:) 'it is only the \"antecedent nonexistence\" of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the (action of) the potter and others, and comes into a relationship with the existing pot-halves which are its own (material) causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes [Such as production, destruction, etc.] but the \"nonexistence after destruction\" of that very pot does not do so, though it, too, is nonexistence. Hence, the \"nonexistence after destruction\", etc. [Etc. stands for 'mutual nonexistence (anyonya-abhava)' and 'absolute nonexistence (atyanta-abhava)'.] are not fit for any empirical processes, whereas only the \"antecedent nonexistence\" of things called dvyanuka etc. is fit for such empirical processes as origination etc.'-all this is incongruous, since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable, as are 'absolute nonexistence' and 'nonexistence after destruction'. Vaisesika: Well, it is not at all said by us that the 'antecedent nonexistence' becomes existent. Vedantin: In that case, the existent itself becomes existent , as for instance, a pot's becoming a pot, or a cloth's becoming a cloth. This, too, like nonexistence becoming existent, goes against valid evidence. Even the theory of transformation held by the Sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the Vaisesikas, since they believe in the origination of some new attribute [i.e. in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before.] and its destruction. Even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted, yet there will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance. Hery is also refuted the idea that origination etc. (of an effect) are merely particular states of its cuase. As thelast alternative, it is only the one entity called Existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination, destruction, etc. like an actor (on a stage). This veiw of the Lord has been stated in the verse, 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷.' (2.16). For, the idea of existence is constant, while the others are inconstant. Objection: If the Self be immutable, then how does the 'renunciation of all actions' become illogical? Vedantin: If the adjuncts (i.e. body and organs) be real or imagined through ignorance, in either case, action, which is their attribute, is surely superimposed on the Self through ignorance. From this point of view it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment (cf. 3.5). The enlightened person, on the other hand, can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through Illumination; for it is illogical that there can (then) remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance. Indeed, no trace remains of the two moons, etc. superimposed by the vision affected by (the disease called) Timira when the desease is cured. This being so, the utterance, 'having given up all actions mentally' (5.13), etc. as also, 'Being devoted to his own duty' (45) and 'A human being achieves 'success by adoring Him through his own duties (46), becomes justifiable. What was verily spoken of as the success arising from Karma (-yoga), characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in Knowledge,-the fruit of that (fitness), characterized as 'steadfastness in Knowledge' consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one (i.e. a monk) free from duties, has to be stated. Hence the (following) verse is begun:"

परंतु आत्मा न तो कहीं भी विषय माना जाता है और न आकारवान् ही। उ0 -- किंतु आदित्यवर्ण प्रकाशस्वरूप स्वयंज्योति इस तरह आत्माका आकारवान् होना तो श्रुतिमें कहा है। पू0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि वे वाक्य तमःस्वरूपत्वका निषेध करनेके लिये कहे गये हैं। अर्थात् आत्मामें द्रव्यगुण आदिके आकारका प्रतिषेध करनेपर जो आत्माके अन्धकाररूप माने जानेकी आशङ्का होती है? उसका प्रतिषेध करनेके लिये ही आदित्यवर्णम् इत्यादि वाक्य हैं क्योंकि अरूपम् आदि वाक्योंसे विशेषतः रूपका प्रतिषेध किया गया है और इसका ( आत्माका ) रूप इन्द्रियोंके सामने नहीं ठहरता? इसको ( आत्माको ) कोई भी आंखोंसे नहीं देख सकता यह अशब्द है? अस्पर्श है इत्यादि वचनोंसे भी आत्मा किसीका विषय नहीं है? यह बात कही गयी है। सुतरां जैसा आत्मा है वैसा ही ज्ञान है यह कहना युक्तियुक्त नहीं है। तब फिर आत्माका ज्ञान कैसे होता है क्योंकि सभी ज्ञान? जिसको विषय करते हैं उसीके आकारवाले होते हैं और आत्मा निराकार है ऐसा कहा है। फिर ज्ञान और आत्मा दोनों निराकार होनेसे उसमें भावना और निष्ठा कैसे हो सकती है उ0 -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि आत्माका अत्यन्त निर्मलत्व? स्वच्छत्व और सूक्ष्मत्व सिद्ध है और बुद्धिका भी आत्माके सदृश निर्मलत्व आदि सिद्ध है? इसलिये उसका आत्मचैतन्यके आकारसे आभासित होना बन सकता है। बुद्धिसे आभासित मन? मनसे आभासित इन्द्रियाँ और इन्द्रियोंसे आभासित स्थूल शरीर है। इसलिये सांसारिक मनुष्य देहमात्रमें ही आत्मदृष्टि करते हैं। देहात्मवादी लोकायतिक? चेतनाविशिष्ट शरीर ही आत्मा है ऐसा कहते हैं? दूसरे? इन्द्रियोंको चेतन कहनेवाले हैं तथा कोई मनको और कोई बुद्धिको चेतन कहनेवाले हैं। कितने ही? उस बुद्धिके भी भीतर व्याप्त? अव्यक्तकोअव्याकृतसंज्ञक अविद्यावस्थ ( चिदाभास ) को आत्मरूपसे समझनेवाले हैं। बुद्धिसे लेकर शरीरपर्यन्त सभी जगह आत्मचैतन्यका आभास ही उनमें आत्माकी भ्रान्तिका कारण है। अतः ( यह सिद्ध हुआ कि ) आत्मविषयक ज्ञान विधेय नहीं है। तो क्या विधेय है नामरूप आदि अनात्मा वस्तुओंका जो आत्मामें अध्यारोप है उसकी निवृत्ति ही कर्तव्य है। आत्मचैतन्यका विज्ञान प्राप्त करना नहीं है क्योंकि ज्ञान? अविद्याद्वारा आरोपित समस्त पदार्थोंके आकारमें ही विशेषरूपसे ग्रहण किया हुआ है। यही कारण है कि विज्ञानवादी बौद्ध विज्ञानसे अतिरिक्त अन्य कोई वस्तु ही नहीं है इस प्रकार मानते हैं और उस ज्ञानको स्वसंवेद्य माननेके कारण प्रमाणान्तरकी आवश्यकता नहीं मानते। सुतरां ब्रह्ममें जो अविद्याद्वारा अध्यारोप किया गया है? उसका निराकरणमात्र कर्तव्य है। ब्रह्मज्ञानके लिये प्रयत्न कर्तव्य नहीं है क्योंकि ब्रह्म तो अत्यन्त प्रसिद्ध ही है। ब्रह्म यद्यपि अत्यन्त प्रसिद्ध? सुविज्ञेय? अति समीप और आत्मस्वरूप है तो भी वह विवेकरहित मनुष्योंको? अविद्याकल्पित नामरूपके भेदसे उनकी बुद्धि भ्रमित हो जानेके कारण? अप्रसिद्ध? दुर्विज्ञेय? अति दूर और दूसरासा प्रतीत हो रहा है। परंतु जिनकी बाह्याकार बुद्धि निवृत्त हो गयी है? जिन्होंने गुरु और आत्माकी कृपा लाभ कर ली है? उनके लिये इससे अधिक सुप्रसिद्ध? सुविज्ञेय? सुखस्वरूप और अपने समीप कुछ भी नहीं है। प्रत्यक्षउपलब्ध धर्ममय इत्यादि वाक्योंसे भी यही बात कही गयी है। कितने ही अपनेको पण्डित माननेवाले यों कहते हैं कि आत्मतत्त्व निराकार होनेके कारण उसको बुद्धि नहीं पा सकती अतः सम्यक् ज्ञाननिष्ठा दुःसाध्य है। ठीक है? जो गुरुपरम्परासे रहित हैं? जिन्होंने वेदान्तवाक्योंको ( विधिपूर्वक ) नहीं सुना है? जिनकी बुद्धि सांसारिक विषयोंमें अत्यन्त आसक्त हो रही है? जिन्होंने यथार्थ ज्ञान करानेवाले प्रमाणोंमें परिश्रम नहीं किया है? उनके लिये यही बात है। परंतु जो उनसे विपरीत हैं? उनके लिये तो? लौकिक ग्राह्यग्राहक भेदयुक्त,वस्तुओंमें सद्भाव सम्पादन करना ( इनको सत्य समझना ) अत्यन्त कठिन है क्योंकि उनको आत्मचैतन्यसे अतिरिक्त दूसरी वस्तुकी उपलब्धि ही नहीं होती। यह ठीक इसी तरह है? अन्यथा नहीं है। यह बात हम पहले सिद्ध कर आये हैं और भगवान्ने भी कहा है कि जिसमें सब प्राणी जागते हैं? ज्ञानी मुनिकी वही रात्रि है इत्यादि। सुतरां आत्मस्वरूपके अवलम्बनमें? बाह्य नानाकार भेदबुद्धिकी निवृत्ति ही कारण है क्योंकि आत्मा कभी किसीके भी लिये अप्रसिद्ध? प्राप्तव्य? त्याज्य या उपादेय नहीं हो सकता। आत्माको अप्रसिद्ध मान लेनेपर तो सभी प्रवृत्तियोंको निरर्थक मानना सिद्ध होगा। इसके सिवा न तो यह कल्पना की जा सकती है कि अचेतन शरीरादिके लिये ( सब कर्म किये जाते हैं ) और न यही कि सुखके लिये सुख है या दुःखके लिये दुःख है क्योंकि सारे व्यवहारका प्रयोजन अन्तमें आत्माके ज्ञानका विषय बन जाना है। इसलिये? जैसे अपने शरीरको जाननेके लिये अन्य प्रमाणकी अपेक्षा नहीं है? वैसे ही आत्मा उससे भी अधिक अन्तरतम होनेके कारण आत्माको जाननेके लिये प्रमाणान्तरकी आवश्यकता नहीं है अतः यह सिद्ध हुआ कि विवेकियोंके लिये आत्मज्ञाननिष्ठा सुप्रसिद्ध है। जिनके मतमें ज्ञान निराकार और अप्रत्यक्ष है उनको भी? ज्ञेयका बोध ( अनुभव ) ज्ञानके ही अधीन होनेके कारण? सुखादिकी तरह ही ज्ञान अत्यन्त प्रसिद्ध है? यह मान लेना चाहिये। तथा ज्ञानको जाननेके लिये जिज्ञासा नहीं होती इसलिये भी ( यह मान लेना चाहिये कि ज्ञान प्रत्यक्ष है ) यदि ज्ञान अप्रत्यक्ष होता? तो अन्य ज्ञेय वस्तुओंकी तरह उसको भी जाननेके लिये इच्छा की जाती? अर्थात् जैसे ज्ञाता ( पुरुष ) घटादिरूप ज्ञेय पदार्थोंका ज्ञानके द्वारा अनुभव करना चाहता है? उसी तरह उस ज्ञानको भी अन्य ज्ञानके द्वारा जाननेकी इच्छा करता? परंतु यह बात नहीं है।  सुतरां ज्ञान अत्यन्त प्रत्यक्ष है और इसीलिये ज्ञाता भी अत्यन्त ही प्रत्यक्ष है। अतः ज्ञानके लिये प्रयत्न कर्तव्य नहीं है? किंतु अनात्मबुद्धिकी निवृत्तिके लिये ही कर्तव्य है इसीलिये ज्ञाननिष्ठा सुसंपाद्य है।।50।।",
      "English": "18.50 Nibodha, understand for certain; me, from Me, from My utterance-. Is it elaborately? The Lord says, no, samasena, in brief; eva, indeed, O son of Kunti, how siddhim praptah, one who has achieved success, one who, by worshipping God through one's duties, has achieved success in the form of fitness of the body and organs for steadfastness in Knowledge, which comes from His grace; (-the reiteration of the phrase siddhim praptah is meant for introducing what follows; what is that succeeding subject for which this reiteration stands is being answered:) yatha tatha, that process by which, that process in the form of steadfastness in Knowledge, by which that process of aciring steadfastness in Knowledge by which; apnoti, attains; brahma, Brahman, th supreme Self-. In order to point out-as 'It is this'-the realization of Brahman which was promised in, 'that process by which one৷৷.attains Brahman,' the Lord says; ya, which; is the para, supreme; nistha, consummation, i.e. the supreme culmination; jnanasya, of Knowledge. Of what? Of the knowledge of Brahman. Of what kind is it? It is of the same kind as the realization of the Self. Of what kind is that? As is the Self. Of what nature is It? As has been described by the Lord and the Upanisadic texts, and established through reason. Objection: Is it not that knowledge takes the form of its object? But it is not admitted anywhere that the Self is an object, or even that It has form. Pseudo-Vedantin: Is it not heard of in such texts as, 'radiant like the sun' (Sv. 3.8), 'Of the nature of effulgence' (Ch. 3.14.2) and 'Self-effulgent' (Br. 4.3.9), that the Self has form? Objection: No, because those sentences are meant for refuting the idea that the Self is of the nature of darkness. When the Self is denied of possessing forms of substance, ality, etc., the contingency arises of the Self's being of the nature of darkness. The sentences, 'radiant like the sun,' etc. are meant for ruting this. And this follows from the specific denial of from by saying, 'Formless' (Ka. 1.3.15), and from such texts as, 'His form does not exist within the range of vision; nobody sees Him with the eye' (Ka. 2.3.9: Sv. 4.20), 'soundless, touchless' (ka. 1.3.15), etc. which show that the Self is not an object of perception. Therefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the Self. How, then, can there be the knowledge of the Self? For, all knowledge that there can be with regard to objects assumes their respective forms. And it has been said that the Self has no form. Moreover, if both knowledge and the Self be formless, then how can there be the consummation [Firmness in Self-realization.] of the (repeated) contemplation on that (knowledge of the Self)? Vedantin: No. Since it can be established that the Self is supremely taintless, pure and subtle, and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness etc. like the Self, therefore it stands to reason that the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the Self. The mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect; the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind; and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs. Hence it is that the idea of the body itself being the Self is held by ordinary people. The Lokayatikas (materialists), who hold that the body is identical with consciousness, say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness; so also there are others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness; there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness, and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness. Some accept as the Self the Unmanifest [The inmost Ruler (antaryamin), possessing a semblance of Consciousness.], called the Undifferentiated, which is more internal than that (intellect) and is within the domain of (primordial) ignorance. Indeed, in every case, beginning from the intellect to the body, the cause of mis-conceived Selfhood is the semblance of the Consciousness that is the Self. Hence, knowledge about the Self is not a subject for injunction. What then? Only the eradication of the superimposition of name, form, etc., which are not the Self, is what has to be undertaken, but not the knowledge of the Self that is Consciousness. For it is the Self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed (on It) through ignorance. It is evidently because of this that the Buddhists who uphold the view of (momentary) consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from (momentary) consciousness, and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is self-cognized. Therefore, what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on Brahman through ignorance, but no effort is needed for knowing Brahman (Consciousness), for It is ite self-evident! It is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that Brahman, even though self-evident, easily realizable, nearer than all else and identical with oneself, appears to be concealed, difficult to realize, very far and different, But to those whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind, there is nothing more blissful, manifest, well known, easily realized and nearer to oneself than this Self. And thus it has been declared, 'directly realizable, righteous,' etc. (9.2). However, some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the Self since It is formless; hence, complete steadfastness in Knowledge is impossible. This is truly so for those who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers; who have not heard the Upanisads; whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects; and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge. For those, on the other hand, who are the opposite of these, it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects, which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known, because in their case there is no perception of any other thing apart from the Consciousness that is the Self. We have already said how this is certainly so and not otherwise. It has been stated by the Lord also, 'That during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage' (2.69). Therefore, the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the Self. For, that which is called the Self is never an object which is not well known, attainable, rejectable or acceptable to anyone at any time. Were that Self to be indeed not self-evident, all activities would become meaningless. [According to Ast. the latter portion of this sentence is: svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran, all activities meant for one's own benefit would become meaningless.-Tr.]. For it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body etc. Besides, it cannot be that pleasure is for pleasure's sake, or that sorrow is for sorrow's sake. Moreover, all empirical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the Self. [According to B.S. 3.4.26, 'On the strength of the Upanisadic sanction of sacrifices etc. all religious activities as well are necessary৷৷.', sacrifices etc. are meant for leading to the realization of the Self, without which they would become meaningless.] Therefore, just as for knowing one's own body there is no need of any other (external) means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge, for the realization of the Self which is innermost (in relation to the body etc.). Hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people. Even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cognized by direct perception, cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge. Hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure etc. And this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know (knowledge). Had knowledge been not self-evident, it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge. And in that case, as [This is Ast.'s reading; others read tatha.-Tr.] a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot etc., similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge! But this is not the case. Therefore knowledge is ite self-revealing, and for the very same reason the knower also is self-revealed. Hence, effort is not needed for knowledge, but only for the removal of the notion of what is not-Self. [In place of anatma-buddhi-nivrttau, Ast. has 'anatmani atma-buddhi-nivrttau, for the termination of thinking what is not the Self as the Self'.-Tr.] Conseently, steadfastness in Knowledge is easy of accomplishment. It is being stated how this supreme consummation of Knowledge is to be attained:"

      "English": "18.55 Bhaktya, through devotion, through that devotion described as Knowledge; abhijanati, he knows; mam, Me; tattvatah, in reality; as to yavan, what I am, with the extensive differences created by limiting adjuncts; and yah asmi, who I am when all distinctions create by the limiting adjuncts are destroyed-Me who am the supreme Person comparable to space [In points of all-pervasiveness and non-attachment.] and one-without-a-second, absolute, homogeneous Consciousness, birthless, ageless, immortal, fearless and deathless. Tatah, then; jnatva, having known; mam, Me, thus; tattvatah, in truth; visate, he enters into Me, Myself; tadanantaram, immediately after that (Knowledge). Here, by saing, 'having known, he enters without delay', it is not meant that the acts of 'knowing' and 'entering immediately after' are different. What then? What is meant is the absolute Knowledge itself that has to no other result, [In place of phalantarabhava-jnana-matram eva, Ast. reads 'phalantarbhavat jnanamatram eva, absolute Knowledge itself, since there is no other result'.-Tr.] for it has been said, 'And৷৷.understand Me to be the \"Knower of the field\", (13.2). Opponent: Has it not been contradictory to say, he knows Me through that which is the supreme steadliness (nistha) in Knowledge? Vedantin: If it be asked, How it is contradictory? Opponent: The answer is: Whenever any Knowledge of something arises in a knower, at that very moment the knower knows that object. Hence, he does not depend on steadfastness in Knowledge which consists in the repetition of the act of knowing. And therefore, it is contradictory to say one knows not through knowledge, but through steadfastness in knowledge which is a repetition of the act of knowing. Vedantin: There is no such fault, since the culmination of Knowledge-which (Knowledge) is associated with the causes of its unfoldment and maturity, and which has nothing to contradict it- in the conviction that one's own Self has been realized is what is referred to by the word nistha (consummation): When knowledge-which concerns the identity of the 'Knower of the field' and the supreme Self, and which remains associated with the renunciation of all actions that arise from the perception of the distinction among their accessories such as agent etc., and which unfolds from the instruction of the scriptures and teachers, depending on purity of the intellect etc. and humility etc. which are the auxiliary cuases of the origin and maturity of Knowledge-continues in the form of the conviction that one's own Self has been realized, then that continuance is called the supreme steadfastness (nistha) in Knowledge. This steadfastness in Knowledge that is such has been spoken of as the highest, the fourth kind of devotion in relation to the three other devotions viz of the afflicted, etc. (cf. 7.16). Through that highest devotion one realizes the Lord in truth. Immediately after that the idea of difference between the Lord and the Knower of the field vanishes totally. There-fore the statement, 'one knows Me through devotion in the form of steadfastness in Knowledge', is not contradictory. And, in this sense, all the scriptures-consisting of Vedanta (Upanisads etc.), History, Mythology and Smrtis-, as for instance, 'Knowing (this very Self the Brahmanas) renounce৷৷.and lead a mendicant's life' (Br. 3.5.1), 'Therefore they speak of monasticism as excellent among these austerities' (Ma. Na. 24.1), 'Monasticism verily became supreme' (ibid. 21.2), which enjoin renunciation become meaningful. Thus, monasticism means renunciation of rites and duties. There are also the texts, 'Having renounced the Vedas as well as this world and the next' (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.9.13), and 'Give up religion and irreligion' (Mbh. Sa. 329.40; 331.44), etc. And here (in the Gita) also various relevant) passages have been pointed out. In is not porper that those texts should be meaningless. Nor are they merely eulogistic, since they occur in their own contexts. Besides, Liberation consists in being established in the changeless real nature of the indwelling Self. Indeed, it is not possible that one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course! And steadfastness in Knowledg consists in being totally absorbed in maintaining a current of thought with regard to the indwelling Self. And that is opposed to coexistence with duties, like going to the western sea. It has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between a mountain and a mustard seed! Therefore it is established that one should have recourse to steadfastness in Knowledge only, by relinishing all rites and duties. The fruit of the attainment of success from the Yoga of Devotion consisting in worshiping the Lord with one's own actions is the ability to remain steadfast in Knowledge, from which, follows stead-fastness in Knowledge, culminating in the result, Liberation. That Yoga of Devotion to the Lord is now being praised in this concluding section dealing with the purport of the Scripture, with a veiw to generating a firm conviction with regard to it (the purport of the Scripture):"

Knowing Me truly, he rises to a higher level than this Bhakti, and aciring knowledge of the truth, enters into Me through devotion. The meaning is that he attains Me by means of infinite and unsurpassed Bhakti which develops subseent in time to the vision of the nature, attributes and glory of the Lord in reality. Here the term 'Tatah' (through) denotes that devotion is the cause of attainment; for it has been stated to be the cause of entrance n the text, 'But by singel-minded devotion it is possible ৷৷.' (11.54). In this way, the crowning development has been told starting from the disinterested performance of periodical and occasional rites suitable for the various stations and stages of life, which are to be performed to propitiate the Supreme Person. Sri Krsna now explains that even for actions meant for attaining desired objects (Kamya-karmas) the crowning stage is the same as for these described above, provided they too are done not for fulfilling one's desires but as offerings to propitiate the Supreme Person."

Knowing Him thus, one becomes here immortal; there is no path for immortality' (Sve. U., 3.8); what is designated by words such as knowledge (Vedanta), meditation (Dhyana) and worship (Upasana); what is of the form of direct perception (Darsana) having the character of continuous succession of memory of a surpassingly loving nature to the worshipped - it is this that is enjoined herein by the words 'Focus your mind on Me,' 'Be My devotee.' It means, be one to whom I am incomparably dear. Since I am the object of superabundant love, meditate on Me, i.e., practise the succession of memory of unsurpassed love of Me. Such is the meaning. Be My worshipper (yaji). Here also the expression, 'Be My devotee' is applicable. Yajna is worship. Worship Me as one exceedingly dear to you. Worship (Aradhana) is complete subservience to the Lord. Prostrate before Me. Prostration means bowing down. The meaning is: Bow down humbly before Me with great love. Renouncing thus all ego-centredness, you shall come to Me. I make this solemn promise to you. Do not take it as a mere flattery. For you are dear to Me. It has been already stated, 'For I am inexpressibly dear to the man of knowledge and dear is he to Me' (7.17). He in whom there is surpassing love for Me, I hold him also as surpassingly dear to Me. Conseently, not being able to bear separation from him, I myself will enable him to attain Me.

( एकमात्र ) अकर्ता? क्रियारहित और फलसे रहित आत्मा मैं हूँ? मुझसे भिन्न और कोई भी नहीं है ऐसा आत्मविषयक ज्ञान इस अविद्याका नाशक है क्योंकि यह उत्पन्न होते ही? कर्मप्रवृत्तिकी हेतुरूप भेदबुद्धिका नाश करनेवाला है। उपर्युक्त वाक्यमें तु शब्द दोनों पक्षोंकी निवृत्तिके लिये है अर्थात् मोक्ष न तो केवल कर्मसे मिलता है और न ज्ञानकर्मके समुच्चयसे ही। इस प्रकार तु शब्द दोनों पक्षोंका खण्डन करता है। मोक्ष अकार्य अर्थात् स्वतःसिद्ध है? इसलिये कर्मोंको उसका साधन मानना नहीं बन सकता क्योंकि कोई भी नित्य ( स्वतःसिद्ध ) वस्तु कर्म या ज्ञानसे उत्पन्न नहीं की जाती। , पू O -- तब तो केवल ज्ञान भी व्यर्थ ही है उ O -- यह बात नहीं है क्योंकि अविद्याका नाशक होनेके कारण उसकी मोक्षप्राप्तिरूप फलपर्यन्तता प्रत्यक्ष है। अर्थात् जैसे दीपकके प्रकाशका? रज्जु आदि वस्तुओंमें होनेवाली सर्पादिकी भ्रान्तिको और अन्धकारको? नष्ट कर देना ही फल है और जैसे उस प्रकाशका फल सर्पविषयक विकल्पको हटाकर? केवल रज्जुको प्रत्यक्ष कराके? समाप्त हो जाता है? वैसे ही अविद्यारूप अन्धकारके नाशक आत्मज्ञानका भी फल? केवल,आत्मस्वरूपको प्रत्यक्ष कराके ही समाप्त होता देखा गया है। जिनका फल प्रत्यक्ष है? ऐसी जो लकड़ीको चीरना अथवा अरणीमन्थनद्वारा अग्नि उत्पन्न करना आदि क्रियाएँ हैं? उनमें लगे हुए कर्ता आदि कारकोंकी? जैसे अलगअलग टुकड़े हो जाना? अथवा अग्नि प्रज्वलित हो जाना आदि फलसे अतिरिक्त किसी अन्य फल देनेवाले कर्ममें प्रवृत्ति नहीं हो सकती? वैसे ही जिसका फल प्रत्यक्ष है? ऐसी ज्ञाननिष्ठारूप क्रियामें लगे हुए ज्ञाता आदि कारकोंकी भी आत्मकैवल्यरूप फलसे अतिरिक्त फलवाले किसी अन्य कर्ममें प्रवृत्ति नहीं हो सकती। अतः ज्ञाननिष्ठा कर्मसहित नहीं हो सकती। यदि कहो कि भोजन और अग्निहोत्र आदि क्रियाओंके समान ( इसमें भी समुच्चय ) हो सकता है तो ऐसा कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि जिसका फल कैवल्य ( मोक्ष ) है? उस ज्ञानके प्राप्त होनेके पश्चात् कर्मफलकी इच्छा नहीं रह सकती? जैसे सब ओरसे परिपूर्ण जलाशयके प्राप्त हो जानेपर कूपतालाब आदिकी जलके लिये चाह नहीं रहता? उसी प्रकार मोक्ष जिसका फल है? ऐसे ज्ञानकी प्राप्ति होनेके बाद क्षणिक सुखरूप फलान्तरकी या उसकी साधनभूत क्रियाकी इच्छुकता नहीं रह सकती। क्योंकि जो मनुष्य राज्य प्राप्त करा देनेवाले कर्ममें लगा हुआ है उसकी प्रवृत्ति? क्षेत्रप्राप्ति ही जिसका फल है ऐसे कर्ममें नहीं होती और उस कर्मके फलकी इच्छा भी नहीं होता। सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि परम कल्याणका साधन न तो कर्म है और न ज्ञानकर्मका समुच्चय ही है तथा कैवल्य ( मोक्ष ) ही जिसका फल है? ऐसे ज्ञानको कर्मोंकी सहायता भी अपेक्षित नहीं है क्योंकि ज्ञान अविद्याका नाशक है इसलिये उसका कर्मोंसे विरोध है। यह प्रसिद्ध ही है कि अन्धकारका नाशक अन्धकार नहीं हो सकता। इसलिये केवल ज्ञान ही परम कल्याणका साधन है। पू O -- यह सिद्धान्त ठीक नहीं क्योंकि नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेसे प्रत्यवाय होता है और मोक्ष नित्य है। भाव यह कि -- पहले जो यह कहा गया कि केवल ज्ञानसे ही मोक्ष मिलता है? ठीक नहीं क्योंकि वेदशास्त्रमें कहे हुए नित्यकर्मोंके न करनेसे नरकादिकी प्राप्तिरूप प्रत्यवाय होगा। यदि कहो कि ऐसा होनेसे तो कर्मोंसे छुटकारा ही न होगा? अतः मोक्षके अभावका प्रसङ्ग आ जायगा? तो ऐसा दोष नहीं है क्योंकि मोक्ष नित्यसिद्ध है। नित्यकर्मोंका आचरण करनेसे तो प्रत्यवाय न होगा? निषिद्ध कर्मोंका सर्वथा त्याग कर देनेसे अनिष्ट ( बुरे ) शरीरोंकी प्राप्ति न होगी? काम्यकर्मोंका त्याग कर देनेके कारण इष्ट ( अच्छे ) शरीरोंकी प्राप्ति न होगी तथा वर्तमान शरीरको उत्पन्न करनेवाले कर्मोंका? फलके उपभोगसे क्षय हो जानेपर? इस शरीरका नाश हो जानेके पश्चात्? दूसरे शरीरकी उत्पत्तिका कोई कारण नहीं रहनेसे तथा शरीरसम्बन्धी आसक्ति आदिके न करनेसे? जो स्वरूपमें स्थित हो जाना है वही कैवल्य है? अतः बिना प्रयत्नके ही कैवल्य सिद्ध हो जायगा। उ O -- किंतु भूतपूर्व अनेक जन्मोंके किये हुए जो स्वर्गनरक आदिकी प्राप्तिरूप फल देनेवाले अनेक अनारब्धफल -- सञ्चित कर्म हैं? उनके फलका उपभोग न होनेके कारण? उनका तो नाश नहीं होगा -- ऐसा कहें तो पू O -- यह बात नहीं है क्योंकि नित्यकर्मके अनुष्ठानमें होनेवाले परिश्रमरूप दुःखभोगको? उस कर्मोंके फलका उपभोग माना जा सकता है। अथवा प्रायश्चित्तकी भाँति नित्य कर्म भी पूर्वकृत पापका नाश करनेवाले मान लिये जायँगे तथा प्रारब्धकर्मका फलभोगसे नाश हो जायगा? फिर नये कर्मोंका आरम्भ न करनेसे कैवल्य,बिना यज्ञके सिद्ध हो जायगा। उ O -- यह सिद्धान्त ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि उस ( परमात्मा ) को जानकर ही मनुष्य मृत्युसे तरता है मोक्षप्राप्तिके लिये दूसरा मार्ग नहीं है इस प्रकार मोक्षके लिये विद्याके अतिरिक्त अन्य मार्गका अभाव बतलानेवाली श्रुति है तथा जैसे चमड़ेकी भाँति आकाशको लपेटना असम्भव है? उसी प्रकार अज्ञानीकी मुक्ति असम्भव बतलानेवाली भी श्रुति है? एवं पुराण और स्मृतियोंमें भी यही कहा गया है कि ज्ञानसे ही कैवल्यकी प्राप्ति होती है। इसके सिवा ( उस सिद्धान्तमें ) जिनका फल मिलना आरम्भ नहीं हुआ ऐसे पूर्वकृत पुण्योंके नाशकी उत्पत्ति न होनेसे भी? यह पक्ष ठीक नहीं है। अर्थात् जिस प्रकार पूर्वकृत सञ्चित पुण्योंका होना सम्भव है? उसी प्रकार सञ्चित पापोंका होना भी सम्भव है ही अतः देहान्तरको उत्पन्न किये बिना उनका क्षय सम्भव न होनेसे ( इस पक्षके अनुसार ) मोक्ष सिद्ध नहीं हो सकेगा। इसके सिवा? पुण्यपापके कारणरूप राग? द्वेष और मोह आदि दोषोंका? बिना आत्मज्ञानके मूलोच्छेद होना सम्भव न होनेके कारण भी? पुण्यपापका उच्छेद होना सम्भव नहीं। तथा श्रुतिमें नित्यकर्मोंका पुण्यलोककी प्राप्तिरूप फल बतलाया जानेके कारण और अपने कर्मोंमें स्थित वर्णाश्रमावलम्बी इत्यादि स्मृतिवाक्योंद्वारा भी यही बात कही जानेके कारण भी कर्मोंका क्षय ( मानना ) सिद्ध नहीं होता। तथा जो यह कहते हैं कि नित्यकर्म दुःखरूप होनेके कारण पूर्वकृत पापोंका फल ही है? उनका अपने स्वरूपसे अतिरिक्त और कोई फल नहीं है क्योंकि श्रुतिमें उनका कोई फल नहीं बतलाया गया तथा उनका,विधान जीवननिर्वाह आदिके लिये किया गया है। उनका कहना ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि जो कर्म फल देनेके लिये प्रवृत्त नहीं हुए? उनका फल होना असम्भव है और नित्यकर्मके अनुष्ठानका परिश्रम? अन्य कर्मका फलविशेष है यह बात भी सिद्ध नहीं की जा सकेगी। तुमने जो यह कहा? कि पूर्वजन्मकृत पापकर्मोंका फल? नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानमें होनेवाले परिश्रमरूप दुःखके द्वारा भोगा जाता है? सो ठीक नहीं क्योंकि मरनेके समय जो कर्म भविष्यमें फल देनेके लिये अङ्कुरित नहीं हुए उनका फल दूसरे कर्मोंद्वारा उत्पन्न हुए शरीरमें भोगा जाता है? यह कहना युक्तियुक्त नहीं है। यदि ऐसा न हो तो स्वर्गरूप फलका भोग करनेके लिये अग्निहोत्रादि कर्मोंसे उत्पन्न हुए जन्ममें? नरकके कारणभूत कर्मोंका फल भोगा जाना भी? युक्तिविरुद्ध नहीं होगा। इसके सिवा यह ( नित्यकर्मके अनुष्ठानमें होनेवाला परिश्रमरूप दुःख ) पापोंकी फलरूप दुःखविशेष सिद्ध न हो सकनेके कारण भी तुम्हारा कहना ठीक नहीं है क्योंकि भिन्नभिन्न प्रकारके दुःखसाधनरूप फल देनेवाले? अनेक ( सञ्चित) पापोंके होनेकी सम्भावना होते हुए भी? नित्यकर्म अनुष्ठानके परिश्रममात्रको ही उन सबका फल मान लेनेपर? शीतोष्णादि द्वन्द्वोंकी अथवा रोगादिकी पीड़ासे होनेवाले दुःखोंको पापोंका फल नहीं माना जा सकेगा तथा यह हो भी कैसे सकता है कि नित्यकर्मके अनुष्ठानका परिश्रम ही पूर्वकृत पापोंका फल है? सिरपर पत्थर आदि ढोनेका दुःख उसका फल नहीं इसके सिवा? नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे होनेवाला परिश्रमरूप दुःख पूर्वकृत पापोंका फल है? यह कहना प्रकरणविरुद्ध भी है। पू O -- कैसे उ O -- जो पूर्वकृत पाप? फल देनेके लिये अङ्कुरित नहीं हुए हैं? उनका क्षय नहीं हो सकता ऐसा प्रकरण है? उसमें तुमने? फल देनेके लिये प्रस्तुत हुए पूर्वकृत पापोंका ही फल? नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे होनेवाला परिश्रमरूप दुःख बतलाया है? जो कर्म फल देनेके लिये प्रस्तुत नहीं हुए हैं उनका फल नहीं बतलाया। यदि तुम यह मानते हो? कि पूर्वकृत सभी पाप कर्म? फल देनेके लिये प्रवृत्त हो चुके हैं? तो फिर नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानका परिश्रमरूप दुःख ही उनका फल है? यह विशेषण देना अयुक्त ठहरता है। और नित्यकर्मविधायक शास्त्रको भी व्यर्थ माननेका प्रसङ्ग आ जाता है। क्योंकि फल देनेके लिये अङ्कुरित हुए पापोंका तो उपभोगसे ही क्षय हो जायगा ( उनके लिये नित्यकर्मोंकी क्या आवश्यकता है )। इसके सिवा ( वास्तवमें ) वेदविहित नित्यकर्मोंसे होनेवाला परिश्रमरूप दुःख यदि कर्मका फल हो तो वह उन ( विहित नित्यकर्मों ) का ही फल होना चाहिये क्योंकि वह व्यायाम आदिकी भाँति? उनके ही अनुष्ठानसे होता हुआ दिखलायी देता है? अतः यह कल्पना करना कि वह किसी अन्य कर्मका फल है युक्तियुक्त नहीं है। नित्यकर्मोंका विधान जीवनादिके लिये किया गया है इसलिये भी नित्यकर्मोंको प्रायश्चित्तकी भाँति पूर्वकृत पापोंका फल मानना युक्तियुक्त नहीं है। जिस पापकर्मके लिये जो प्रायश्चित विहित है? वह उस पापका फल नहीं है। तथापि यदि ऐसा मानें? कि प्रायश्चित्तरूप दुःख ( जिसके लिये प्रायश्चित्त किया जाय ) उस पापरूप निमित्तका ही फल होता है? तो जीवनादिके लिये किये जानेवाले नित्यकर्मोंका परिश्रमरूप दुःख भी? जीवन आदि हेतुओंका ही फल सिद्ध होगा क्योंकि नित्य और प्रायश्चित्त ये दोनों ही किसीनकिसी निमित्तसे किये जानेवाले हैं? इनमें कोई भेद नहीं है। इसके सिवा दूसरा दोष यह भी है कि नित्यकर्मके परिश्रमकी और काम्यअग्निहोत्रादि कर्मके परिश्रमकी समानता होनेके कारण? नित्यकर्मका परिश्रम ही पूर्वकृत पापका फल है? काम्यकर्मानुष्ठानका परिश्रमरूप दुःख उसका फल नहीं है? ऐसा माननेके लिये कोई विशेष कारण नहीं है? अतः वह काम्यकर्मका परिश्रमरूप दुःख भी? पूर्वकृत पापका ही फल माना जायगा। ऐसा होनेसे नित्यकर्मोंका फल नहीं बतलाया गया है और उनके अनुष्ठानका विधान किया गया है? उस विधानकी अन्य प्रकारसे उपपत्ति न होनेके कारण? नित्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे होनेवाला दुःख? पूर्वकृत पापोंका ही फल है? इस प्रकारकी जो अर्थापत्तिकी कल्पना की गयी थी? उसका खण्डन हो गया। इस तरह प्रकारान्तरसे नित्यकर्मोंके विधानकी अनुपपत्ति होनेसे और नित्यकर्मोंका अनुष्ठानसम्बन्धी परिश्रमरूप दुःखके सिवा दूसरा फल होता है? ऐसा अनुमान होनेसे भी ( यह पक्ष खण्डित हो जाता है )। इसके सिवा ऐसा माननेमें विरोध होनेके कारण भी ( यह पक्ष कट जाता है )। नित्यकर्मोंका अनुष्ठान करते हुए दूसरे कर्मोंका फल भोगा जाता है? ऐसा मान लेनेसे यह कहना होता है कि वह उपभोग ही नित्यकर्मका फल है। और साथ ही यह भी प्रतिपादन करते जाते हो कि नित्यकर्मका फल नहीं है अतः यह कथन परस्पर विरुद्ध होता है। इसके अतिरिक्त ( तुम्हारे मतानुसार ) काम्यअग्निहोत्रादिका अनुष्ठान करते हुए तन्त्रसे नित्यअग्निहोत्रादि भी उन्हींके साथ अनुष्ठित हो जाते हैं। अतः उस परिश्रमरूप दुःखभोगसे ही काम्यअग्निहोत्रादिका फल भी क्षीण हो जायगा क्योंकि वह उसके अधीन है। यदि ऐसा मानें कि काम्यअग्निहोत्रादिका स्वर्गादि प्राप्तिरूप दूसरा ही फल होता है तो उनके अनुष्ठानमें होनेवाले परिश्रमरूप दुःखको भी नित्यकर्मके परिश्रमसे भिन्न मानना आवश्यक होगा। परंतु प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाणसे विरुद्ध होनेके कारण यह नहीं हो सकता। क्योंकि काम्यकर्मोंके अनुष्ठानसे होनेवाले परिश्रमरूप दुःखसे? केवल नित्यकर्मअनुष्ठानमें होनेवाले परिश्रमरूप दुःखका भेद नहीं है। इसके सिवा दूसरी बात यह भी है कि जो कर्म न विहित हो और न प्रतिषिद्ध हो? वही तत्काल फल देनेवाला होता है? शास्त्रविहित या प्रतिषिद्ध कर्म तत्काल फल देनेवाला नहीं होता। यदि ऐसा होता तो स्वर्ग आदि लोकोंका प्रतिपादन करनेमें और अदृष्ट फलोंके बतलानेमें शास्त्रकी प्रवृत्ति नहीं होती। कर्मत्वमें किसी प्रकारका भेद न होनेपर तथा अंग और इतिकर्तव्यता आदिकी कोई विशेषता न होनेपर भी? केवल नित्यअग्निहोत्रादिका फल तो अनुष्ठानजनित परिश्रमरूप दुःखके उपभोगसे क्षय हो जाता है और फलेच्छुकतामात्रकी अधिकतासे काम्यअग्निहोत्रादिका स्वर्गादि महाफल होता है? ऐसी कल्पना नहीं की जा सकती। सुतरां नित्यकर्मोंका अदृष्ट फल नहीं होता यह बात कभी भी सिद्ध नहीं हो सकती। इसलिये यह सिद्ध हुआ कि अविद्यापूर्वक होनेवाले सभी शुभाशुभ कर्मोंका? अशेषतः नाश करनेवाला हेतु? विद्या ( ज्ञान ) ही है? नित्यकर्मका अनुष्ठान नहीं। क्योंकि सभी कर्म अविद्या और कामनामूलक हैं। ऐसा ही हमने सिद्ध किया है? कि अज्ञानीका विषय कर्म है और ज्ञानीका विषय सर्वकर्मसंन्यासपूर्वक ज्ञाननिष्ठा है। उभौ तौ न विजानीतः वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यम् ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् अज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम् तत्त्ववित्तु गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्त इति मत्वा न सज्जते सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते, नैव किंचित् करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् इत्यादि वाक्योंके अर्थसे यही सिद्ध होता है? कि अज्ञानी ही,मैं कर्म करता हूँ ऐसा मानता है ( ज्ञानी नहीं )। आरुरुक्षुके लिये कर्म कर्तव्य बतलाये हैं और आरूढके लिये अर्थात् योगस्थ पुरुषके लिये उपशम कर्तव्य बतलाया है। तथा ( ऐसा भी कहा है कि ) तीनों प्रकारके अज्ञानी भक्त भी उदार हैं? पर ज्ञानी तो मेरा स्वरूप ही है? ऐसा मैं मानता हूँ। कर्म करनेवाले सकाम अज्ञानी लोग आवागमनको प्राप्त होते हैं और अनन्य भक्त नित्ययुक्त होकर चिन्तन करते हुए आत्मस्वरूप? आकाशके सदृश? मुझ निष्पाप परमात्माकी उपासना किया करते हैं। उनको मैं वह बुद्धियोग देता हैं जिससे वे मुझे प्राप्त हो जाते हैं इससे यह सिद्ध होता है कि कर्म करनेवाले अज्ञानी भगवान्को प्राप्त नहीं होते। भगवदर्थ कर्म करनेवाले जो युक्ततम होनेपर भी कर्मी होनेके नाते अज्ञानी हैं? वे चित्तसमाधानसे लेकर कर्मफलत्यागपर्यन्त उत्तरोत्तर हीन बतलाये हुए साधनोंसे युक्त होते हैं। तथा जो अनिर्देश्य अक्षरके उपासक हैं वे अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानाम् आदिसे लेकर? बारहवें अध्यायकी समाप्तिपर्यन्त बतलाये हुए साधनोंसे सम्पन्न और तेरहवें अध्यायसे लेकर तीन अध्यायोंमें बतलाये हुए ज्ञानसाधनोंसे भी युक्त होते हैं। अधिष्ठानादि पाँच जिसके कारण हैं? ऐसे समस्त कर्मोंका जो संन्यास करनेवाले हैं? जो आत्माके एकत्व और अकर्तृत्वको जाननेवाले हैं? जो ज्ञानकी परानिष्ठामें स्थित हो गये हैं? जो भगवत्स्वरूप और आत्माके एकत्वज्ञानकी शरण हो चुके हैं ऐसे भगवान्के तत्त्वको जाननेवाले परमहंस परिव्राजकोंको इष्टअनिष्ट और मिश्र -- ऐसा त्रिविध कर्मफल नहीं मिलता। इनसे अन्य जो संन्यास न करनेवाले कर्म परायण अज्ञानी हैं उनको कर्मका फल अवश्य भोगना पड़ता है यही गीताशास्त्रमें कहे हुए कर्तव्य और अकर्तव्यका विभाग है। पू O -- सभी कर्मोंको अविद्यामूलक मानना युक्तिसङ्गत नहीं है। उ O -- नहीं? ब्रह्महत्यादि निषिद्ध कर्मोंकी भाँति ( सभी कर्म अविद्यामलूक हैं ) नित्यकर्म यद्यपि शास्त्रप्रतिपादित हैं तो भी वे अविद्यायुक्त पुरुषके ही कर्म हैं। जैसे प्रतिषेधशास्त्रसे कहे हुए भी अनर्थके कारणरूप ब्रह्महत्यादि निषिद्ध कर्म अविद्या और कामनादि दोषोंसे युक्त पुरुषके द्वारा ही हो सकते हैं क्योंकि दूसरी तरह उनमें प्रवृत्ति नहीं हो सकती। उसी प्रकार नित्यनैमित्तिक और काम्य आदि कर्म भी? अविद्या और कामनासे युक्त मनुष्यसे ही हो सकते हैं। पू O -- परंतु आत्माको शरीरसे पृथक् समझे बिना नित्यनैमित्तिक आदि कर्मोंमें प्रवृत्तिका होना असम्भव है। उ O -- यह कहना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि आत्मा जिसका कर्ता नहीं है ऐसे चलनरूप कर्ममें ( अज्ञानियोंकी ) मैं करता हूँ ऐसी प्रवृत्ति देखी जाती है। यदि कहो कि शरीर आदिमें जो अहंभाव है वह गौण है? मिथ्या नहीं है। तो ऐसा कहना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि ऐसा माननेसे उनके कार्यमें भी गौणता सिद्ध होगी। पू O -- जैसे हे पुत्र तू मेरा आत्मा ही है इस श्रुतिवाक्यके अनुसार? अपने पुत्रमें अहंभाव होता है तथा संसारमें भी जैसे यह गौ मेरा प्राण ही है इस प्रकार प्रिय वस्तुमें अहंभाव होता देखा जाता है? उसी प्रकार अपने शरीरादि संघातमें भी अहंभाव गौण ही है। यह प्रतीति मिथ्या नहीं है। मिथ्या प्रतीति तो वह है कि जो स्थाणु और पुरुषके भेदको न जानकर स्थाणुमें पुरुषकी प्रतीति होती है। उ O -- ( यह कहना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि ) गौण प्रयोग लुप्तोपमा शब्दद्वारा अधिकरणकी स्तुति करनेके लिये होता है? इसलिये गौण प्रतीतिसे मुख्यके कार्यकी सिद्धि नहीं होती। जैसे कोई कहे कि देवदत्त सिंह है? या बालक अग्नि है? तो उसका यह कहना? देवदत्त सिंहके सदृश क्रूर और बालक अग्निके समान पिङ्गल ( गौर ) वर्ण? इस प्रकारकी समानताके कारण देवदत्त और बालकरूप अधिष्ठानकी स्तुतिके लिये ही है। क्योंकि गौण शब्द या गौण ज्ञानसे कोई सिंहका कार्य ( किसीको भक्षण कर जाना ) या अग्निका कार्य ( किसीको जला डालना ) सिद्ध नहीं किया जा सकता। परंतु मिथ्या प्रत्ययका कार्य ( जन्ममरणरूप ) अनर्थ? ( मनुष्य ) अनुभव कर रहा है। इसके सिवा गौण प्रतीतिके विषयको मनुष्य ऐसा जानता भी है कि वास्तवमें यह देवदत्त सिंह नहीं है और यह बालक अग्नि नहीं है। ( यदि उपर्युक्त प्रकारसे शरीरादि संघातमें भी आत्मभाव गौण होता तो ) शरीरादिके संघातरूप गौण आत्माद्वारा किये हुए कर्म? अहंभावके मुख्य विषय आत्माके किये हुए नहीं माने जाते। क्योंकि गौण सिंह,( देवदत्त ) और गौण अग्नि ( बालक ) द्वारा किये हुए कर्म मुख्य सिंह और अग्निके नहीं माने जाते। तथा उस क्रूरता और पिङ्गलताद्वारा कोई मुख्य सिंह और मुख्य अग्निका कार्य नहीं किया जा सकता? क्योंकि वे केवल स्तुतिके लिये कहे हुए होनेसे हीनशक्ति हैं। जिनकी स्तुति की जाती है वे ( देवदत्त और बालक ) भी यह जानते हैं कि मैं सिंह नहीं हूँ? मैं अग्नि नहीं हूँ तथा सिंहका कर्म मेरा नहीं है? अग्निका कर्म मेरा नहीं है। इसी प्रकार ( यदि शरीर आदिमें गौण भावना होती तो ) संघातके कर्म मुझ मुख्य आत्माके नहीं हैं -- ऐसी ही प्रतीति होनी चाहिये थी? ऐसी नहीं कि मैं कर्ता हूँ? मेरे कर्म हैं ( सुतरां यह सिद्ध हुआ कि शरीरमें आत्मभाव गौण नहीं? मिथ्या है )। जो ऐसा कहते हैं कि अपने स्मृति? इच्छा और प्रयत्न इन कर्महेतुओंके द्वारा आत्मा कर्म किया करता है? उनका कथन ठीक नहीं क्योंकि ये सब मिथ्या प्रतीतिपूर्वक ही होनेवाले हैं। अर्थात् स्मृति? इच्छा और प्रयत्न आदि सब मिथ्या प्रतीतिसे होनेवाले? इष्टअनिष्टरूप अनुभूत कर्मफलजनित संस्कारोंको? लेकर ही होते हैं। जिस प्रकार इस वर्तमान जन्ममें धर्म? अधर्म और उनके फलोंका अनुभव ( सुखदुःख ) शरीरादि संघातमें आत्मबुद्धि और रागद्वेषादिद्वारा किये हुए होते हैं? वैसे ही भूतपूर्व जन्ममें और उससे पहलेके जन्मोंमें भी थे। \\n इस न्यायसे यह अनुमान करना चाहिये कि यह बीता हुआ और आगे होनेवाला ( जन्ममरणरूप ) संसार अनादि एवं अविद्याकर्तृक ही है। इससे यह सिद्ध होता है? कि ज्ञाननिष्ठामें सर्वकर्मोंके संन्याससे संसारकी आत्यन्तिक निवृत्ति हो जाती है क्योंकि देहाभिमान अविद्यारूप है अतः उसकी निवृत्ति हो जानेपर शरीरान्तरकी प्राप्ति न होनेके कारण,( जन्ममरणरूप ) संसारकी प्राप्ति नहीं हो सकती। शरीरादि संघातमें जो आत्माभिमान है वह अविद्यारूप है क्योंकि संसारमें भी मैं गौ आदिसे अन्य हूँ और गौ आदि वस्तुएँ मुझसे अन्य हैं ऐसा जाननेवाला कोई भी मनुष्य उनमें ऐसी बुद्धि नहीं करता कि यह मैं हूँ। न जाननेवाला ही स्थाणुमें पुरुषकी भ्रान्तिके समान अविवेकके कारण? शरीरादि संघातमें मैं हूँ ऐसा आत्मभाव कर सकता है पर विवेकपूर्वक जाननेवाला नहीं कर सकता। तथा पुत्रमें जो हे पुत्र तू मेरा आत्मा ही है ऐसी आत्मबुद्धि है? वह जन्यजनकसम्बन्धके कारण होनेवाली गौण बुद्धि है? उस गौण आत्मा ( पुत्र ) से भोजन आदिकी भाँति कोई मुख्य कार्य नहीं किया जा सकता। जैसे कि गौण सिंह और गौण अग्निरूप देवदत्त और बालकद्वारा? मुख्य सिंह और मुख्य अग्निका कार्य नहीं किया जा सकता। पू O -- स्वर्गादि अदृष्ट पदार्थोंके लिये कर्मोंका विधान करनेवाली श्रुतिका प्रमाणत्व होनेसे? यह सिद्ध होता है कि शरीरइन्द्रिय आदि गौण आत्माओंके द्वारा मुख्य आत्माके कार्य किये जाते हैं। उ O -- ऐसा कहना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि उनका आत्मत्व अविद्याकर्तृक है। अर्थात् शरीर? इन्द्रिय आदि गौण आत्मा नहीं हैं ( किंतु मिथ्या हैं )। पू O -- तो फिर ( इनमें आत्मभाव ) कैसे होता है उ O -- मिथ्या प्रतीतिसे ही सङ्गरहित आत्माकी सङ्गति मानकर? इनसे आत्मभाव किया जाता है क्योंकि उस मिथ्याप्रतीतिके रहते हुए ही उनमें आत्मभावकी सत्ता है? उसके अभावसे आत्मभावनाका भी अभाव हो जाता है। अभिप्राय यह कि मूर्ख अज्ञानियोंका ही अज्ञानकालमें मैं बड़ा हूँ ? मैं गौर हूँ इस प्रकार शरीरइन्द्रिय आदिके संघातमें आत्माभिमान देखा जाता है। परंतु मैं शरीरादि संघातसे अलग हूँ ऐसा समझनेवाले विवेकशीलोंकी? उस समय शरीरादि संघातमें अहंबुद्धि नहीं होती। सुतरां? मिथ्याप्रतीतिके अभावसे देहात्मबुद्धिका अभाव हो जानेके कारण? यह सिद्ध होता है कि शरीरादिमें आत्मबुद्धि अविद्याकृत ही है? गौण नहीं। जिनकी समानता और विशेषता अलगअलग समझ ली गयी है? ऐसे सिंह और देवदत्तमें या अग्नि और बालक आदिमें ही गौण प्रतीति या गौण शब्दका प्रयोग हो सकता है जिनकी समानता और विशेषता नहीं समझी गयी उनमें नहीं। तुमने जो कहा कि श्रुतिको प्रमाणरूप माननेसे यह पक्ष सिद्ध होता है कि वह भी ठीक नहीं क्योंकि उसकी प्रमाणता अदृष्टविषयक है। अर्थात् प्रत्यक्षादि प्रमाणोंसे उपलब्ध न होनेवाले अग्निहोत्रादिके? साध्य? साधन और सम्बन्धके विषयमें ही श्रुतिकी प्रमाणता है प्रत्यक्षादि प्रमाणोंसे उपलब्ध हो जानेवालेविषयोंमें नहीं। क्योंकि श्रुतिकी प्रमाणता अदृष्ट विषयको दिखलानेके लिये ही है ( अर्थात् अप्रत्यक्ष विषयको बतलाना ही उसका काम है )। सुतरां देहादिसंघातमें? प्रत्यक्ष ही मिथ्या ज्ञानसे होनेवाली अहंप्रतीतिको? गौण मानना नहीं बन सकता। क्योंकि अग्नि ठण्डा है या अप्रकाशक है ऐसा कहनेवाली सैकड़ों श्रुतियाँ भी प्रमाणरूप नहीं मानी जा सकतीं। यदि श्रुति ऐसा कहे कि अग्नि ठण्डा है अथवा अप्रकाशक है तो ऐसा मान लेना चाहिये कि श्रुतिको कोई और ही अर्थ अभीष्ट है। क्योंकि अन्य प्रकारसे उसकी प्रामाणिकता सिद्ध नहीं हो सकती। परंतु प्रत्यक्षादि अन्य प्रमाणोंके विरुद्ध या श्रुतिके अपने वचनोंके विरुद्ध श्रुतिके अर्थकी कल्पना करना उचित नहीं। पू O -- कर्म मिथ्या ज्ञानयुक्त पुरुषद्वारा ही किये जानेवाले हैं? ऐसा माननेसे वास्तवमें कर्ताका अभाव हो जानेके कारण श्रुतिकी अप्रमाणता ( अनर्थकता ) ही सिद्ध होती है ऐसा कहें तो उ O -- नहीं? क्योंकि ब्रह्मविद्यामें उसकी सार्थकता सिद्ध होती है। पू O -- कर्मविधायक श्रुतिकी भाँति ब्रह्मविद्याविधायक श्रुतिकी अप्रमाणताका प्रसङ्ग आ जायगा? ऐसा माने तो उ O -- यह ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि उसका कोई बाधक प्रत्यय नहीं हो सकता। अर्थात् जैसे ब्रह्मविद्याविधायक श्रुतिद्वारा आत्मसाक्षात्कार हो जानेपर? देहादि संघातमें आत्मबुद्धि बाधित हो जाती है? वैसे आत्मामें ही होनेवाला आत्मभावका बोध किसीके द्वारा किसी भी कालमें किसी प्रकार भी बाधित नहीं किया जा सकता। क्योंकि वह आत्मज्ञान स्वयं ही फल है? उससे भिन्न किसी अन्यफलकी प्राप्ति नहीं है? जैसे अग्नि उष्ण और प्रकाशस्वरूप है। इसके सिवा ( वास्तवमें ) कर्मविधायक श्रुति भी अप्रामाणिक नहीं है? क्योंकि वह पूर्वपूर्व ( स्वाभाविक ) प्रवृत्तियोंको रोकरोककर उत्तरोत्तर नयीनयी ( शास्त्रीय ) प्रवृत्तिको उत्पन्न करती हुई ( अन्तमें अन्तःकरणकी शुद्धिद्वारा साधकको ) अन्तरात्माके सम्मुख करनेवाली प्रवृत्ति उत्पन्न करती है। अतः उपाय मिथ्या होते हुए भी? उपेयकी सत्यतासे? उसकी सत्यता ही है जैसे कि विधिवाक्यके अन्तमें कहे जानेवाले अर्थवादवाक्योंकी सत्यता मानी जाती है। लोकव्यवहारमें भी ( देखा जाता है कि ) उन्मत्त और बालक आदिको दूध आदि पिलानेके लिये चोटी बढ़ने आदिकी बात कही जाती है। तथा आत्मज्ञान होनेसे पहले? देहाभिमाननिमित्तक प्रत्यक्षादि प्रमाणोंके प्रमाणत्वकी भाँति प्रकारान्तरमें स्थित,( कर्मविधायक ) श्रुतियोंकी साक्षात् प्रमाणता भी सिद्ध होती है। तुम जो यह मानते हो? कि आत्मा स्वयं क्रिया न करता हुआ भी सन्निधिमात्रसे कर्म करता है? यही आत्माका मुख्य कर्तापन है। जैसे राजा स्वयं युद्ध न करते हुए भी सन्निधिमात्रसे ही अन्य योद्धाओंके युद्ध करनेसे राजा युद्ध करता है ऐसे कहा जाता है तथा वह जीत गया? हार गया ऐसे भी कहा जाता है। इसी प्रकार सेनापति भी केवल वाणीसे ही आज्ञा करता है। फिर भी राजा और सेनापतिका उस क्रियाके फलसे सम्बन्ध होता देखा जाता है। तथा जैसे ऋत्विक्के कर्म यजमानके माने जाते हैं? वैसे ही देहादि संघातके कर्म आत्मकृत हो सकते हैं? क्योंकि उनका फल आत्माको ही मिलता है। तथा जैसे भ्रामक ( भ्रमण करानेवाला चुम्बक ) स्वयं क्रिया नहीं करता? तो भी वह लोहेका चलानेवाला है? इसलिये उसीका मुख्य कर्तापन है? वैसे ही आत्माका मुख्य कर्तापन है। ऐसा मानना ठीक नहीं? क्योंकि ऐसा माननेसे न करनेवालेको कारक माननेका प्रसङ्ग आ जायगा। यदि कहो कि कारक तो अनेक प्रकारके होते हैं? तो भी तुम्हारा कहना ठीक नहीं क्योंकि राजा आदिका मुख्य कर्तापन भी देखा जाता है। अर्थात् राजा अपने निजी व्यापारद्वारा भी युद्ध करता है। तथा योद्धाओंसे युद्ध कराने और उन्हें धन देनेसे भी निःसन्देह उसका मुख्य कर्तापन है? उसी प्रकार जयपराजय आदि फलभोगोंमें भी उसकी मुख्यता है। वैसे ही यजमानका भी प्रधान आहुति स्वयं देनेके कारण और दक्षिणा देनेके कारण निःसन्देह मुख्य कर्तृत्व है। इससे यह निश्चित होता है कि क्रियारहित वस्तुमें जो कर्तापनका उपचार है वह गौण है। यदि राजा और यजमान आदिमें स्वव्यापाररूप मुख्य कर्तापन न पाया जाता तो उनका सन्निधिमात्रसे भी मुख्य कर्तापन माना जा सकता था? जैसे कि लोहेको चलानेमें चुम्बकका सन्निधिमात्रसे मुख्य कर्तापन माना जाता है? परंतु चुम्बककी भाँति राजा और यजमानका स्वव्यापार उपलब्ध न होता होऐसी बात नहीं है। सुतरां सन्निधिमात्रसे जो कर्तापन है वह भी गौण ही है। ऐसा होनेसे उसके फलका सम्बन्ध भी गौण ही होगा? क्योंकि गौण कर्ताद्वारा मुख्य कार्य नहीं किया जा सकता। अतः यह मिथ्या ही कहा जाता है कि निष्क्रिय आत्मा देहादिकी क्रियासे कर्ताभोक्ता हो जाता है। परंतु भ्रान्तिके कारण सब कुछ हो सकता है। जैसे कि स्वप्न और मायामें होता है। परंतु शरीरादिमें,आत्मबुद्धिरूप अज्ञानसन्ततिका विच्छेद हो जानेपर? सुषुप्ति और समाधि आदि अवस्थाओंमें कर्तृत्व? भोक्तृत्व आदि अनर्थ उपलब्ध नहीं होता। इससे यह सिद्ध हुआ? कि यह संसारभ्रम मिथ्या ज्ञाननिमित्तक ही है? वास्तविक नहीं? अतः पूर्ण तत्त्वज्ञानसे उसकी आत्यन्तिक निवृत्ति हो जाती है।",
      "English": "18.66 Sarva-dharman, all forms of rites and duties: Here the word dharma (righteousness) includes adharma (unrighteousness) as well; for, what is intended is total renunciation of all actions, as is enjoined in Vedic and Smrti texts like, 'One who has not desisted from bad actions' (Ka. 1.2.24), 'Give up religions and irreligion' (Mbh. Sa. 329.40), etc. Parityajya, abandoning all rites and duties; [Being a Ksatriya, Arjuna is not alified for steadfastness in Knowledge through monasticism in the primary sense. Still, the Gita being meant for mankind as a whole, monasticism is spoken of here by accepting Arjuna as a representative man.] saranam vraja, take refuge; mam ekam, in Me alone, the Self of all, the same in all, existing in all beings, the Lord, the Imperishable, free from being in the womb, birth, old age and death-by knowing that I am verily so. That is, know it for certain that there is nothing besides Me. By revealing My real nature, aham, I; moksayisyami, shall free; tva, you, who have this certitude of understanding; sarva-paphyah, from all sins, from all bondages in the form of righteousness and unrighteousness. It has also been stated, 'I, residing in their hearts, destroy the dark-ness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of Knowledge' (10.11). Therefore, ma, do not; sucah, grieve, i.e. do not sorrow. In this scripture, the Gita, has knowledge been established as the supreme means to Liberation, or is it action, or both? Why does the doubt arise? (Because) the passages like, '৷৷.by realizing which one attains Immortality' (13.12), 'Then, having known Me in truth, he enters (into Me) immediately after that (Knowledge)' (55), etc. point to the attainment of Liberation through Knowledge alone. Texts like, 'Your right is for action alone' (2.47), '(you undertake) action itself (4.15), etc. show that actions have to be under-taken as a matter of compulsory duty. Since both Knowledge and action are thus enjoined as duties, therefore the doubt may arise that they, in combination as well, may become the cause of Liberation. Objection: What, again, would be the result of this iniry? Vedantin: Well, the resut will verily be this: The ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good. Hence this has to be investigated more extensively. Knowledge of the Self, however, is exclusively the cause of the highest good; for, through the removal of the idea of differences, it culminates in the result that is Liberation. The idea of distinction among action, agent and result is ever active with regard to the Self because of ignorance. This ignorance in the form, 'My work; I am the agent; I shall do this work for that resut', has been at work from time without beginning. The dispeller of this ignorance is this Knowledge regarding the Self-in the form, 'I am the absolute, non agent, free from action and result; there is none else other than myself because, when it (Knowledge) arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action. The word 'however' above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives. This refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cannot be attained through mere actions, nor by a combination of Knowledge and action. Besides, since Liberation is not a product, therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means. Indeed, an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of Knowledge. Objection: In that case, ever exclusive Knowledge is purposeless. Vedantin: No, since Knowledge, being the destroyer of ignorance, culminates in Liberation which is directly experienced result. The fact that Knowledge, which removes the darkness of ignorance, culminates in Liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the form of sanke etc. and darkness from objects such as rope etc. Indeed, the result of light amounts to the mere (awareness of the) rope, free from the wrong notions of snake etc. So is the case with Knowledge. As in the case of the acts like 'cutting down', 'producing fire by friction' etc., in which accessories such as the agent and others operate, and which have perceivable results, there is no possiblity of (the agent etc.) engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from 'splitting into two', 'seeing (or lighting of) fire' etc, similarly, in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the 'act' of steadfastness in Knowledge which has a tangible result, there is no possibility of (their) engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the Self. Hence, steadfastness in Knowledge combined with action is not logical. Objection: May it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and Agnihotra sacrifice etc.? [As such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such Vedic rites as the Agnihotra-sacrifice, so, actions can be combined with Knowledge.] Vedantin: No, since it is unreasonable that, when Knowledge which resutls in Liberation is attained, there can remain a hankering for results of actions. Just as there is no desire for an action or its result [Action, i.e. digging etc.; result, i.e. bathing etc.] in connection with a well, pond, etc. when there is a flood all around, similarly when Knowledge which has Liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for any other result or any action which leads to it. Indeed, when somody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom, there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land, or having a longing for it! Hence, action does not constitute the means to the highest good. Nor do Knowledge and action in combination. Further, Knowledge which has Liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action, because, being the remover of ignorance, it is opposed (to action). Verily, darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness. Therefore Knowledge alone is the means to the highest good. Objection: Not so, because from non-performance of nityakarmas one incurs sin. Besides, freedom (of the Self) is eternal. As for the view that Liberation is attainable through Knowledge alone, it is wrong. For, if nityakarmas [As also the occasional duties (naimittika-karmas).] which are prescribed by the Vedas are not performed, then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell etc. Counter-objection: If this be so, then, since Liberation cannot come from action, will there not arise the contingency of there being no Liberation at all? Pseudo-Vedantin: Not so, for Liberation is eternal. as a result of performing nityakarmas there will not be incurring of evil, and as a result of not doing any prohibited action (nisiddha-karma) there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body; from relinishing actions meant for desired results (kamya-karmas) there will be no possibility of being born in some desirable body. Since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them, and since one does not have attachment etc., therefore Liberation consists in the mere continuance of the Self in Its own natural state. Thus, Liberation is attained without effort. Objection: May it not be argued that, since in the case of actions done in many past lives-which are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven, hell, etc. but have not commenced bearing results-there is no possiblity of their being experienced, therefore they cannot be exhausted? Pseudo-Vedantin: No, since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be (considered to be) the experiencing of their [i.e. of actions done in past lives, which have not commenced bearing their fruits.-Tr.] results. Or, since the nityakarmas, like expiations, may be considered as being meant for eliminating the sins incurred earlier, and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced, therefore Liberation is attained without effort-provided no fresh actions are performed. Vedantin: No, since there is the Upanisadic text, 'Knowing Him alone, one goes beyond death; there is no other way to go by' (Sv. 3.8), which states that for Liberation there is no other path but enlightenment; also because there is the Upanisadic statement that Liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather (Sv. 6.20); and since it is mentioned in the Puranas and the Smrtis that Liberation follows only from Knowledge. (From your view) it also follows that there is no possibility of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits. And, as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results, similarly there can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits. And so, if there be no scope of their being exhausted without creating another body, then there is no possibility of Liberation. And since attachment, hatred and delusion, which are the causes of virtue and vice, cannot be eradicated through any means other than Knowledge, therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible. Besides, since the Sruti [See Ch. .2.23.1 and Br. 1.5.16-Tr.] mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result, and there is the Smrti text, 'Persons belonging to castes and stages of life, and engaged in their own duties' ['৷৷.attain to a high, immeasurable happiness.'-Tr.] (Ap. Dh. Su. 2.2.2.3), etc., therefore the exhaustion of (the fruits of) actions (through nityakarmas) is not possible. As for those who say, 'The nityakarmas, being painful in themselves, must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past; but apart from being what they are, they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the Vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive'-(this is) not so, because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result. Besides, there is no ground for experiencing a particular conseence in the form of pain [Pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas.] The statement, that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives, is false. Indeed, it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions. Otherwise, there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as Agnihotra etc. and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven! Besides, that (pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas) cannot be the same as the conseence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin. Since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows, therefore, if it be imagined that their (sins') result will be merely in the form of pain arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas, then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they (the sins incurred in the past) are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites (heat and cold, etc.), disease etc., and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas, but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head etc. Further, it is out of context to say this, that the pain resulting from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past. Objection: How? Vedantin: What is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past, which has not begun to bear fruit, cannot be dissipated. In that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit, not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit! On the other hand, if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding their results, then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nitya-karmas is their only result. And there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void, because the sinful deed which has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result. Further, if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the Vedas, then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmas-as in the case of excercise etc. To imagine that it is the result of something else is illogical. [The pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself, and not the result of any past sin! Similarly, the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the conseence of that performance itself, and need not be imagined to be the result of any past sin.] And if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a person's being alive, it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past, any more than expiation is. An expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin! On the other hand, if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause, then the pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas, though prescribed merely on the fact of one's being alive, may become the fruit of that very fact of one's being alive-which was itself the occasion (for enjoining the nityakarmas)-, because both the nityakarmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned. Moreover, there is the other fact: There can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds, but not so the pain from performing kamya-karmas (rites and duties undertaken for desired results), because the pain in performing Agnihotra-sacrifice etc. is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamya-karma. Thus the latter also may be the result of past sinful acts. This being the case, it is untenable to assume on the ground of circumstantial inference that, since no result is enjoined in the Vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on any other ground, therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds. Thus, the (Vedic) injunction being unjustifiable otherwise, it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising from the effort in undertaking them. It also involves this contradiction: It is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced. And when this is admitted, it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma, and yet that niyakarma has no result! Moreover, when Agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results (Kamya-Agnihotra), then the Agnihotra etc. which are performed as nityakarma (Nitya-Agnihotra) become accomplished simultaneously (on a account of its being a part ofthe former). Hence, since the Kamya-Agnihotra (as an act) is dependent on and not different from the Nitya-Agnihotra, therefore the result of the Agnihotra and other sacrifices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it (the Nitya-Agnihotra). On the other hand, if the result of Kamya-Agnihotra etc. be different, viz heaven etc., then even the suffering arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different (from the suffering involved in the Nitya-Agnihotra). And that is not the fact, because it contradicts what is directly perceived; for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the Nitya-(-Agnihotra) does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the Kamya (-Agnihotra). Besides, there is this other consideration: Actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited (by the scriptures) produce immediate results. But those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results; were they to do so, then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven etc. and injunctions concerning unseen results. And it cannot be imagined that only the fruit of (Nitya-) Agnihotra etc. gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them, but the Kamya (-Agnihotra) has exalted results like heaven etc. merely as a conseence of the fact of desire for results, though as acts there is no essential difference between them (the Nitya and the Kamya) and there is no additional subsidiary part, processes of performance, etc. (in the kamya-Agnihotra). Therefore, it can never be established that nitya-karmas have no unseen results. And hence, enlightenment alone, not the performance of nityakarmas, is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance, be they good or bad. For, all actions have for their origin ignorance and desire. Thus has it been established (in the following passages) that action (rites and duties) is meant for the ignorant, and steadfastness in Knowledge-after renunciation of all actions-is meant for the enlightened: 'both of them do not know' (2.19); 'he who knows this One as indestructible, eternal' (2.21); 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (3.3); 'the ignorant, who are attached to work' (3.26); 'But৷৷.the one who is a knower৷৷.does not become attached, thinking thus: \"The organs rest on the objects of the organs\"' (3.28); 'The embodied man৷৷.having given up all actions mentally, continues' (5.13); 'Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, \"I certainly do not do anything\"' (5.8); i.e; the unenlightened person thinks, 'I do'; 'For (the sage) who wishes to ascend (to Dhyana-yoga), action is said to be the means৷৷.when he has ascended (when he is established in the Yoga of Meditation), inaction alone is said to be the means' (6.3); 'noble indeed' are all the three (classes of) unenlightened persons, 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion' (7.18); the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties, 'who are desirous of pleasures, attain the state of going and returning' (9.21); 'becoming non-different from Me and meditative' (9.22) and endowed with steadfast devotion, they worship (Me) the Self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless; and 'I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me' (10.10); i.e., the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties 'do not reach Me.' Those who perform works for the Lord and who, though they be the most devout, are ignorant persons performing rites and duties,-they remain involved in practices which, in a descending order, culminate in giving up the fruit of actions (cf. 12.6-11). But those who meditate on the indefinable Immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with 'He who is not hateful towards any creature' (12.13) and ending with that Chapter, and also resort to the path of Knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the Chapter on the 'field'. The three results of actions, viz the undesirable etc. (cf. 12), do not accrue only to the mendicants belonging to the Order of Paramahamsas (the highest Order of monks)-who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus (cf. 14), who possess the knowledge of the oneness and non-agentship of the Self (17,20), who continue in the supreme steadfastness in Knowledge, who know the real nature of the Lord, and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the Lord with the Self. It does accrue to the others who are not monks, the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties. Such is this distinction made in the scripture Gita with regard to what is duty and what is not. Objection: May it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance? Reply: No, (it can be proved,) as in the case of slaying a Brahmin. Although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures, still they are meant only for the ignorant. As such an action as killing a Brahmin, even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it, is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance, passion, etc.-because impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible-, so also is it with regard to the nitya, naimittika and kamya actions. Objection: May it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma etc. is not possible if the Self be not known as a distinct entity? [Unless one knows the Self to be distinct from the body etc. he will not perform the nityakarmas etc. meant for results in the other worlds, viz heaven etc. (Tr.:) In place of vyatiriktatmani, Ast. reads 'deha-vyatiriktatmani, the Self which is distinct from the body'.] Reply: No, since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the not-Self, one engages in them with the idea, 'I do.' [The actionless Self is not the agent of the movements of the body etc. Still agentship is superimposed on It through ignorance.] Objection: Can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. occurs in a figurative sense; it is not false? Reply: No, since its effects [i.e. the effects of the notion of egoism.] also will become figurative. Objection: The notion of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of one's own body etc. occurs in a figurative sense. As with regard to one's own son it is said (in the Veda), 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa. Br. 14.9.4.26), and in common parlance also it is said, 'This cow is my very life', so is the case here. [As the use of the word 'I' with regard to a son is figurative, so also with regard to the body.] This is certainly not a false notion. However, a false notion (of identity) occurs in the case of a stump and a man, when the distinction between them is not evident (due to darkness). Reply: A figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effect in the real sense, because that (notion) is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood. As for instance, such sentences as, 'Devadatta is a lion', 'The boy is a fire'-implying 'like a lion', 'like a fire', on the basis of the similarity of cruelty, the tawny colour, etc.-are meant only for eulogizing Devadatta and the boy who are the basis (i.e. the subjects of the two sentences). But no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas. On the contrary, one experiences the evil effects of false notions. [Therefore the idea of 'I' with regard to one's body etc. does not occur in a secondary sense, but it does so falsely.] And with regard to the subjects of the figurative notions, one understands, 'This Devadatta cannot be a lion; this boy cannot be a fire.' Similarly, actions done by the aggregate of body etc., which is the 'Self' in a figurative sense, cannot be held to have been done by the Self which is the real subject of the notion of 'I'. For, actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or fire. Nor is any action of the real lion and fire accomplished through the (figurative) cruelty or tawnyaness; for, their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy. And those who are praised know, 'I am not a lion; I am not fire; and neither is the work of a lion or fire mine.' So the more ligical notion is, 'The action of the aggregate (of body etc.) do not belong to me who am the real Self', and not, 'I am the agent; it is my work.' As for the assertion made by some that the Self acts through Its own memory, deisre and effort, which are the causes of activity-that is not so, for they are based on false knowledge. Memory, desire, effort, etc. indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions (-which actions themselves arise from the notions of the 'desirable' and the 'undesirable') caused by false knowledge. [False knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable. From these arise desire and repulsion. Actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results. Such experiences create impressions in the mind, from which are born memory etc.] Just as in this life virtue, vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification (of the Self) with the aggregate of body etc. and attraction, repulsion, etc., so also was it in the previous birth, and even in the life preceding that. Thus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance. And from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence is caused by steadfastness in Knowledge, accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties. Besides, since self-identification with the body is nothing but ignorance, therefore, when the (ignorance) ceases, there remains so possibility of re-birth, and so, mundane existence becomes impossible. The identification of the Self with the aggregate of body etc. is nothing but ignorance, because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows, 'I am different from cattle etc., and the cattle etc. are different from me', entertains the notion of 'I' with regard to them. However, mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man, one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of body etc.; not so when perceiving them as distinct. As for that notion of considering the son to be oneself-as mentioned in, 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa. Br. 14.9.4.26)-, that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter. And no real action like eating etc.can be accomplished through something considered metaphorically as the Self, just as actions of the real lion or fire (cannot be accomplished) by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or fire. Objection: Since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid, therefore, may it not be said that the purposes of the Self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the Self? Reply: No, since the thinking of them as the Self is the result of ignorance. The body, organs, etc. are not the Self in a figurative sense. Objection: How then? Reply: Although the Self is devoid of relationship, still, by an ascription of relationship (to the Self), they (body etc.) come to be regarded as the Self, verily through a false notion. For, this identification (of body etc.) with the Self exists so long as the false notion is there, and ceases to exist when it is not there. So long as ignorance lasts, identification of the Self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in the case of non-discriminating, immature, ignorant poeple who say, 'I am tall', 'I am fair'. But in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge, 'I am different from the aggregate of body etc.', there does not arise the idea of egoism with regard to the body etc. at that time (i.e. simultaneously with that knowledge). Hence, since it (i.e. identification of the Self with the body etc.) ceases in the absence of the false notion, therefore it is a creation of that (false notion), and not a figurative notion. It is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and Devadatta, or of fire and the boy, are known distinctly, that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur; not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown. As for the argument that (the figurative notion should be accepted) on the authority of the Vedas, we say, 'No', because their validity concerns unseen results. The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra etc., which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc., because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception. Therefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body etc., arising from an obviously of false knowledge, is a figurative notion. Surely, even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non-luminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different, for otherwise (its) validity cannot be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement. Objection: May it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship, therefore, when the agent ceases to be so ['According to you (the Vedantin), an ignorant man alone can be an agent. Therefore, when he becomes illumined, he will cease to be ignorant and conseently the Vedas will cease to be valid for him.'] the Vedas will become invalid? Reply: No, since the Vedas become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of Brahman. [Though the Vedic injunctions about rituals etc. be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person, still they have empirical validity before enlightenment. Besides, the Vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of Brahman.] Objection: May it not be said that there arises the contingency of the Vedic texts enjoining knowledge of Brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties? Reply: No, since there cannot possibly be any notion which can remove (the knowledge of Brahman). Unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc. is removed after the realization of the Self from hearing the Vedic injunctions regarding the knowledge of Brahman, the realization of the Self in the Self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoever-just as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable-, since (Self-) realization is inseparable from its result (i.e. cessation of ignorance). Besides, the Vedic texts enjoining rites (and duties) etc. are not invalid, because they, through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies, are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling Self. [The Vedic injunctions make people up rituals etc. by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies. Thery their minds become purified. The purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling Self. Thus, since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling Self, they are not invalid.] Although the means be unreal (in itself), still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves, as are the eulogistic sentences (arthavada) [See note on p. 40.-Tr.] occuring along with injunctions. Even in the world, when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk etc. it is said that it will help growth of hair [Cuda, lit. hair on the top of the head; or single lock of hair left on the crown of the head after tonsure. See V.S.A.] etc.! Before the dawn of Knowledge, the (ritualistic) Vedic texts concerned with a different situation [The situation obtaining before the dawn of Self-knowledge.] are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception etc. occuring due to Self-identification with the body etc. On the other hand, as for your view 'The Self, though inactive by Itself, acts through Its mere proximity; and that itself constitutes agentship of the Self in the primary sense. Just as it is well known that a king, though not himself engaged in a battle, is, merely by virtue of his being in charge, said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting, and that he is victorious or defeated; similarly, as the ?nder of an army acts through his mere orders, and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the ?nder; or, just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificer,-in that very manner are the actions done by the body etc. ought to be of the Self because the result of those actions accrues to the Self. And, as the agentship of a magnet which, in fact, is not active, is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to move, similar is the agentship of the Self'-that is wrong, since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent. Objection: May not agentship be of various kinds? Reply: No, for in the case of the 'king' and others it is seen that they have agentship even in the primary sense. As for the king, he fights even through his personal engagement. And he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making (his) warriors fight, distributing wealth, and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat. Similarly, the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests. Therefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurative. If primary agentship consisting in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king, a sacrificer and others, then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence, just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move. But in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way. Therefore, even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one. And if that be so, the connection with the result of such agentship will also be figurative. No action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so. Hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body etc. the actionless Self becomes an agent and experiencer. But everything becomes possible due to error. This is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery! Besides, in deep sleep, absorption in Brahman, etc. where the current of the mistaken idea of Self-identity with the body etc. ceases, evils like agentship, enjoyership, etc. are not perceived. Therefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge; but it is not reality. Conseently, it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment. Having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture Gita, and having again summarized it specially here at the end (in verse 66) for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the Scripture, now after that, the Lord states the rules for handing down the Scripture:re"

      "English": "18.66 'Relinishing all Dharmas means the complete relinishment of the sense of agency, possessiveness, fruits etc., in the practising of Karma, Jnana and Bhakti Yogas in the way instructed, and the realising of Me as the agent, object of worship, the means and the end. It means that relinishment is not of all devotional duties but only of the sense of agency and the fruits. This is the Sastraic relinishment of all Dharmas. It is firmly established in the beginning of this chapter commencing from, 'Listen regarding My decision, O Arjuna, about abandonment; for abandonment is declared to be of three kinds' (18.4), and 'Renouncing attachments and also the fruit, such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika ৷৷. for it is impossible for one who bears the body to abandon acts entirely. But he who gives up the fruits of works, is called the abandoner' (18.9-11). If you practise such abandonment of the sense of agency and fruits, I will release you from all 'sins' - i.e., I will release you from all evil incompatible with the attainment of Myself, consisting of innumerable acts of the nature of doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to be done. These piled up from beginningless times from the obstruction in the way. Grieve not, you should not despair; for I shall release you from all these obstructions. Another (alternative) explanation is this: Bhakti Yoga is possible only for those people to whom the Lord is exceedingly dear and who are free from all evils. Those evils are so huge in their case that the expiatory rites which could wash them off, could not be performed in the limited time of one's life span. Ajuna therefore thought that he was unfit for commencing Bhakti Yoga. To remove the grief of Arjuna the Lord said: 'Completely relinishing all Dharmas, seek Me alone for refuge.' Expiatory rites can be taken here as what is meant by Dharma, Completely forsake these rites (Dharmas) appropriate for the removal of numerous and varied sins piled up from beginningless time and obstructing the starting of Bhakti Yoga. The expiatory rites consist of practices like Krcchra, Candrayana, Kusmanda, Vaisvanara, Vratapati, Pavitresti, Trvrit, Agnistoma etc., which are of manifold varieties, and which are difficult to perform on account of the brevity of life. So in order to succeed in commencing Bhakti Yoga, seek Me alone for refuge. I am supremely compassionate, the refuge of all without considering the differences of character among them, and am an ocean of tenderness for those dependent on Me. I will release you from all evil, the nature of which has been explained as incompatible with the commencement of Bhakti Yoga. Grieve not. [Both these interpretations of this famous verse are said to teach only Bhakti Yoga and not Prapatti. But the estion will rise in one's mind - why should it not be so taken?]"

It should not be imparted to an austere or even an intelligent person if he lacks service and devotion.

And similarly, in the Upanisadic text beginning with 'I grieve because I am not a knower of the Self' (Ch. 7.1.3), it is shown that all bonds become destroyed when the Self is realized. There are also the words of the Upanisadic verses, 'The knot of the heart gets untied' (Mu. 2.2.8); 'at that time (or to that Self) what delusion and what sorrow can there be for that seer of oneness?'

I have acired that. Misapprehension here is the misconception that the self is the Prakrti (body-mind) which is the non-self in reality. It consists in one not apprehending that all intelligent and non-intelligent entities, by reason of their forming the body of the Supreme Being, have Him as their Atman and are thus ensouled by Him. The misapprehension also consists in the lack of knowledge that actions, obligatory and occasional, do not cause bondage but actually form a means for the propitiation of the Supreme Being. All such misapprehensions are now destroyed. The various phases of knowledge that cleared the misunderstanding may be catalogued as follows: (1) The self is different from Prakrti and is therefore devoid of the alities of Prakrti. Its nature is that of the knower of Prakrti. (2) The self is a Sesa (sub-ordinate and servant) of the Supreme Person and is ruled by Him. The true knowledge about the Supreme Person is that He is what is signified by the expression Supreme Brahman. (3) He is the great ocean of all auspicious, excellent attributes such as knowledge, strength, glory, valour, power, brilliance etc., which are unbounded and natural. His essence consists solely of auspiciousness. He is antagonistic to all that is evil without exception. The origin, sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe are His sport. (4) You (Sri Krsna) are Vasudeva, the Supreme Person, known from the Vedanta, and who can be reached only by worship, which has taken the form of Bhakti. (5) Bhakti can be achieved by the control of the senses and the mind, the abandonment of prohibited acts and the performance of occasional and obligatory acts as solely intended for the goal of the satisfaction of the Supreme Person. Bhakti has to be developed day after day through the regular practice of the discriminatory knowledge of the higher and lower truths. All this has been attained by me (Arjuna). Therefore I stand steadfast, freed from the doubts and devoid of the depression rooted in perverted knowledge nourished by compassion and love for relatives. Now I shall fulfil Your words, concerned with fighting etc., which ought to be done by me. I shall fight as instructed by You. Such is the meaning. Sanjaya now relates to Dhrtarastra who had estioned him earlier as to what his sons and the Pandavas were doing in the battle:"
